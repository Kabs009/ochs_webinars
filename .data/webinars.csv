I'm gonna just switch on so everyone who has their hi Allison, everyone who has
their cameras on, we'll see your lovely faces. Rebecca, nice to have you here.
Welcome to 2025.
Everybody.
So I hope you all had good holidays. It feels like a long time since we've been
together was two weeks of webinar, but three weeks of time, you know? So anyway,
I'm glad to be back among friends. And I wanna say welcome to this week's
installation of our weekly seminar, Getting More From Your Lens.
And I'm Dr. Lisa Merrifield, your facilitator. You can call me Lisa. We keep these
calls casual and they're interdisciplinary so we have the cross -pollination from
people of different backgrounds and it's an hour for us to discuss our cases,
discuss the lens, we're open to things that are theoretical as well as practical and
I'd like to pull the group and see who among us has a real -time clinical need and
you could indicate that either by raising your hand on camera if you have your
camera on or by raising your hand virtually then I'll be able to see that.
Take a look here see
if we have any hands going up.
Alison you're number one in 2025.
>> Well, actually, I just have a great little update. A while back,
we chatted about one of my clients having some symptoms of borderline personality
disorder, and she's had, I want to say, about six to seven sessions since then,
and her insight is growing.
So, it's been really incredible. We're going through a little bit of a phase where
she's chasing boys at 60. Not like little boys, but it's creepy,
right?
But it's been really positive to see her, this felt like a leap for me, but she's
doing so great right now that it's been so wonderful to see her starting to heal
and grow insight and she's moving that locus of control back within herself. - Wow.
Yeah. - Pretty incredible.
- That's not a small thing to have happen. - No, I was not sure.
I worked with her for over a year. And so adding the lens,
I know that they said to wait until you had enough experience, maybe about a year
of lens work. And I kind of rolled her in about four months into my experience.
And
it just has been such a great experience for her. And I'm just so grateful that we
did take the leap. So. Okay. Wow. Wonderful. You know,
that rule of thumb is a rule of thumb. I talked to someone yesterday who got their
lens, I think, in November, but they have among their existing clients,
they had someone with DID who was interested in the lens, and that weighty,
the suggested weight is for the benefit of the clinician, but sometimes life,
you know, life asks us to step up sometimes. So in those cases,
you know, the thing to do is exactly what we're doing here today which is
collaborate with other people who have the experience and see what what they can
pass along and how they you know can support you. The rule of thumb for seizures
things that are can be scary usually you know the rule of thumb is try to wait a
year but it's just not always how it works You know,
so I mean I always say you're called to you're called to help the people in your
practice You know, you can't know every contingency. You can't know what about all
those What about all those mathematics? Well, that's not my clientele They're you
know, I don't have to worry about what protocol would I use for them because that's
not who I'm dealing with I usually get people who are medically complex or heavy
trauma
They're also important, but I only have head space for so many, you know, and
that's kind of how it goes. If your clientele is super sensitive and highly reactive
or just highly reactive,
yeah, David says so many kids are hitting the head that it's hard to know what
that affects. Yeah, I agree. I mean, even like look at the population of people who
are victims of domestic victims of domestic abuse. Among that group, how many people
have suffered head trauma? Probably a pretty high number.
So there are a lot of times there are things that are incidental to life that
actually are huge impediments and people don't have a, they don't, they're unaware
and they're untreated. So they'll just respond very well to the lens.
Anyway, thank you for your update. It's great to start off on a, you know, knowing
about a win. And Rebecca, I see you have your hand up.
Yes, if there's time I have two. One is related to Parkinson's.
This is my first Parkinson's person. So I've been quite on fight a journey with him
and he was diagnosed in 21 and we just started this past fall.
I'll have my 13th session with him soon and we've seen a lot of progress with his
mood and ability to do and make decisions and I think in the first map,
I remember in one of these webinars years ago, in that topical dominant frequency
map, there was two hotspots, you know, right there at C3 and 4,
and I think from what I remember that that might have been a Parkinson's pattern,
that has shifted in the subsequent map. But what I'm most bummed about is that
though he's getting better in other ways about the only Parkinson's symptom that has
gotten better is swallowing but aside from that he like he'll go to put his jacket
on and then his arm will just kind of get stuck and he needs help and so I
wanted to ask what is the default mode network, what are those sites again?
And just what I guess I'm wondering because we're at this point where I could
either recommend he keep going or stop or I just I don't know what to reasonably
expect because I've not I'm not well versed in Parkinson's. So I want to back up
and say Depression is a Parkinson's symptom. It's not a motor symptom. It's a non
-motor symptom of Parkinson's. Okay. I mean, he may have had depression before he got
the Parkinson's diagnosis, but it happens with Parkinson's. And all of those
neurodegenerative conditions eventually, depression is often part of the complex.
With Parkinson's, they talk about motor symptoms and non -motor symptoms. So cognition,
the clarity of thought, that's one aspect of a non -motor, can be a non -motor
symptom where someone has confusion or they don't think as well as they used to.
That's one way. You can have affective effects,
like you can have those surges of emotion sometimes.
I think mostly with Parkinson's we think of things being constricted and getting
flatter, but there can be reactivity on the inside.
But again, non -motor and then mood also we go along with that non -motor.
So in terms of his motor symptoms, have you done anything to track like handwriting
or do you have any anybody who's working with him who can track like gate his gate
or anything like that to see if if it's making a difference or?
I have not done that, um, tracked the motor. I've just kind of what we do is
just, you know, the other day I was on doing it on a shoulder body lens, just to
see if that might help. But I haven't been tracking it overall, just taking him and
his wife's word. And then what I observe of his motor is, and that's where he
wants to see the most improvement. So, yeah. Yeah, Yeah, so, but you don't need to
say this to him, but I wouldn't be surprised if the lens has helped him hang on
to his functioning to some degree. 13 weeks is not a really long time, but you've
got a process that's progressive, and sometimes you can roll back the clock, and
sometimes what you do is you slow down the clock. Of course everybody wants the big
rollback and there's nothing wrong with wanting that and going for it. You mentioned
that you were doing body lens on his shoulder.
Sometimes people try like a body lens on the actual body and then another channel
on the head at the site on the sensory motor cortex that would be related to that.
If you're gonna go on the head, you're gonna go to the contralateral side. So if
it's the right shoulder, you're gonna go to the left part of the sensory motor
strip.
That's a cool idea. Yeah, is he durable?
It's easy to overtreat him. Okay. So though he, I mean,
he's still flying a plane, he's boxing, like, he's doing a lot of amazing things,
but, you know, it's hard for him to get the sheet over him at night.
Stuff like those things are hard, but in general,
it's been he's been more cheerful. He also has a head injury in the mix, but I
think we're past that, but I don't know.
So I think where I'm at is,
yeah, no, that's all been very helpful. Thank you. I do suggest that you get a
handwriting sample from him. Okay, yes, yes. And what's, do I keep working the
default mode network? You can you are asking about the sites associated with that.
That would be FFZ PZ P3 and P4 Thank you.
Yeah, I would how have you done with just following the map?
Great, that's what I've been doing. I just wanted to try the default sure mode
network since he can only do a few sites at a time. What you could do there is
you could put an active at FZ and PZ and then put the references at P3 and P4
and then put the ground on the ear.
And try that if you're if you want to try to get the whole network at once.
Wow.
So just so I put the green clip here and then you know the two sensors and then
the other clip Can you explain how technically okay, so you're using two ear clips
you can you can Do you have another flat another flat?
I do Okay, you can either change the electrode or you can use the back of the
clip electrode and just put the paste on the back of that, but it's gotta be
someplace where it's not gonna fall off. So, like I said, FZ and PZ, you probably
have pretty good luck. If you're gonna use the back of the clip, on the ear clip,
use it for FZ, that's gonna be the flattest. - Okay, yes. - And PZ you'll have,
you know, you'll be coming off a little bit, so. - Thank you. - Yeah, so So that's
something to try. Do you have a photonic stimulator, Rebecca? I can't remember. - I
have this. It's a shine little of a light. Yeah.
And I use that with it. - I'm sorry. - I've used it with him.
- I would pre -treat the sites of the default mode network with your light device.
What's the wavelength?
I don't even know. Okay if it's if it's a if it's a low high wavelength like 650
I don't think it's I wouldn't think that that would be a good bet if it's like
810 or higher. I mean here it is wavelength is longer than you've got something
that's got more ability to penetrate. This one is the infrared is 850 and the red
light is 660. Okay, great. I would use that for three to four minutes over each
side of the default mode network. Okay. Now, with the default mode network,
that's not particularly associated with motor function. So just know that. If you're,
if you're, If you're really hoping, I mean, I think you're in the process, you're
not going to have no effect on the overall complex, but just know that if you
wanted to target the motor function, then you would want to go to the sensory motor
strip, probably. Okay,
thank you. And if I, in session, Rebecca, actually measure his range of motion or
something so that you can see, like before and after, whether it's, if he can't get
range of motion, then assess comfort.
Yeah. Okay, to see if you, and sometimes things bloom and they have an effect
later, they don't have it in the office, but. Right. Okay, because if doing the
light on the head, you use the mini improvement in range of motion or comfort,
he might be able to get a light and do it at home in between visits. Yeah.
I told him about the V light you had mentioned before. He just wasn't ready because
of the there wasn't enough studies, but there's plenty of studies. Tell him there's
a closer look. I'll tell you what, I've got a diagnosis of a neurodegenerative
condition. I would want the photonic stimulator or a V -light or a laser of the
right wavelength. I would be looking at a phototherapy of some sort. So,
and he's flying a plane, but he's got the cognition to do that now. That's a high
risk activity. So the stakes are, you know, this is not somebody who's on a visual.
So, yeah, so, I would, I would encourage him to take a closer look,
but that's me. If I could add, if he's doing boxing,
I would think that's a catastrophic intersection to going worse. If I understood what
you said in the beginning, if he's being hit in the head, I would go, oh my God,
I put a link on a New Zealand doctor who specializes in Parkinson's using red light
therapy. It should be in the link now. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. And the
boxing he does, yeah, I make sure I was like, you're not getting hit in the head,
right? Yeah. Let's go to the jarring, Rebecca. I mean, they They don't call it
Dementia Pugilistica. A lot of times that's the diagnosis for dementia for boxers,
but it looks like Parkinson's. So if you remember Muhammad Ali for a long time,
they didn't call it Parkinson's, they called it Dementia Pugilistica. And then they
said, ""Oh, it's Parkinson's.""
- Well, the irony is this boxing group he's with is it's for Parkinson's.
- They're Parkinson's. There's someone who has a group of Parkinson's patients and
boxing is supposed to help fight Parkinson's. I haven't looked into it a lot, but
that's a fascinating perspective on it. If you're being hit from your belly button
up, I would think that jarring is going to be catastrophic, Making things worse if
not immediately down the road So I would ask if they were hitting heavy bags and
that was their boxing workout. That would be great Yeah, that's what it is It's
back. It's back. It's not hitting each other Okay. Yeah,
and actually one of the the lens times his boxing got worse and he was kind of
bummed about that.
Well let's think about that if when you lift you have somebody who's had a head
injury which he has in his history and the suppression starts lifting we pretty
reliably see the slow way frequencies temporarily increase before they come down as
the the variability is restored to the signal. So So,
it's interesting that he had that happen, but you know, people who have a head full
of slower frequencies will have slower reaction times. Okay. Yeah.
Thank you. Yeah. Something else. If he has not read the chapter in Norman Deutsch's
book, ""The Brain's Way of Healing,"" There's a chapter on Parkinson's and a non
-conventional way of dealing with it, in part involving
consciously engaging in movements that are difficult for Parkinson's like walking,
etc. Consciously doing some of the work with a conscious his brain.
It's hard work.
It'd be worth looking into.
Speedbag work, being useful, getting hit in the head is not going to be helpful,
but the speedbag work would work on coordination and forcing your brain to helping
neuroplasticity maybe especially if you're learning how to do it yeah I'm just
relieved I'm relieved to hear that they're you know they're not actually hitting one
another not actually boxing it's a boxing type workout yeah I can I can provide you
a look at a map I did not a map but just a and four days,
three, yeah, maybe three or four days after a client of mine with a TBI, when he
got hit in an accident.
Yeah, we could do that later.
- Later, today or later, another time? - Later today, I could show you a shot on my
camera if you'd like. - Yeah, that'd be great, Galen. - It also, He might want to
look into low -dose. No, there's not a lot of literature on that, but there's some
of the LDN book volume 2 has a chapter on Parkinson's
Can you type that in the chat, please? I can yes Yeah
So I can do a crew job of showing you a picture.
That is I've got it on my phone. I can show you more or less before. Well let's
make you presenter and see what happens. Well now let me just see if we can do it
with my camera. Well that's what I mean I'm going to put you on who's talking and
you have to talk while you're showing it so you'll be the you'll be what's on the
screen. Okay
So that is what his map generally what his map might have looked like Before the
accident Okay,
and now here's after wow look at that standard deviation Yeah
And it's just chaos for him. He was at a stop sign,
started moving through. This was a slow speed accident, moving through the
intersection and a guy didn't see him and rammed into him. When he got out of the
car, the guy said, ""Oh, damn. Well, I'm legally blind."" But you can just see the
hyper synchronization of brain waves and way yeah and just the reduction of
suppression and then let's see this is what it looked like the next week which it
was returning to a more normal state yes
you can see that the this amplitudes and
helps him hold it together, get hours or a few days of just feeling like his brain
isn't scrambled and he can relax. He definitely noticed,
we took a break for the Christmas holiday of six or seven days. And when he came
back, what he reported was, he could definitely tell after, yeah, around six,
I think it was actually total of nine days, and around day six or seven, he
definitely noticed it was wearing off more. But I could credit Lens with him still
being alive and just him being an incredibly tough, strong person.
But yeah, just the horrible luck of, you know, some, I don't know,
I messed up person driving when they're legally blind.
Yeah, that seems silly. It's just cruel. Yeah, I agree.
He was doing better. And now it's really a setback. Galen, I want to ask this
question of Rebecca and anyone else on the call who has a client who's being
treated for Parkinson's. I'm interested in this B1 protocol that some people are
following. It's a thymine, high -dose thymine. Does anybody know anything anybody who's
used that? I'm not familiar. Okay. I've watched some information about it,
but I don't know anybody personally who's used it and
So I was curious
the the only thing that this client is doing is keto because There's research
somewhere that says keto can help Parkinson's
So he's that's also in the mix, but not the be worn okay yeah and I just a
comment on low -dose naltrexone and Parkinson's is you wouldn't automatically assume an
opiate antagonist would be beneficial because of you know a primary aspect of
Parkinson's is the dopamine issue and lack of access But the opioid system and the
dopamine system are intimately interrelated and regulate one another and that's that's
part of how it would affect as well as the low -dose naltrexone or naltrexone itself
affect the inflammation levels directly Because they directly reduce excess inflammation
in the system
binding with toll -like receptors that govern the microglia.
>> I was going to say, I actually use low -dose naltrexone myself because I had
shingles in my cranial nerves.
I was on super high doses of extended -release gabapentin, and I titrated off of
that while titrating up on the low docental trek zone and most of my pain went
away I didn't I didn't need any other like pain medication that I was even using
with the Gapapentin. Additionally my iron went back up had been low and I could
tell and I went to the doctor almost two weeks from getting it checked I want you
to check it again because I think it's changed and it had gone up 20 points from
starting low docental trek zone. I can't say enough about it. It is incredible.
I think everybody should be on it. - Holy smokes. - Yeah. - Does anybody know whether
that can be delivered in a compounded format? Can it be in a cream? - Yes.
You can get it in a cream. You can get it in a dispenser that looks like a roll
-on deodorant dispenser and it you click something you click it and it delivers the
appropriate dose however it's set a care first pharmacy in New Jersey has that
product it also like Belmar and care first both put it into pills I don't Belmar.
Belmar might also do that. Okay, thank you. We have a child in our office who's
just got terrible GI condition and absorption is a real barrier there and the
inflammation is super super high.
So,
okay, that's that's very, very helpful. Thank you. Yeah, the cross pollination,
you >> Yeah, and the research on GI, on Crohn's and IBS is really some of the
most impressive research on Lotto -Snotrexone, virtually everything responds, and for
children, the topical application could be really helpful because a lot of kids
aren't good at taking pills and they're definitely not going to like the bitter
taste of it. >> Yeah. - Okay, thank you, thank you. Rebecca, is there anything more
that you would want to discuss about your client who has Parkinson's or would you
like to move on to the other client now?
- No, this is wonderful, thank you all so much. - Could we briefly, before we go
on, could we briefly, let me just check and see if David and Courtney had their
hands up and it may be input for you. So, David Finstermaker. No, I was trying to
get un -muted and I was helped with that, and I'll take it down. Okay,
thank you. And Courtney? Yes, I was going to ask when you were talking about the
default mode network being the P3, P4, and FZ, to use the back of the ear clip on
FZ. That's what she said, right? Yes, I said that because if you're going use the
the ear clip on the head it's got weight to it and it doesn't like to stick as
well on if it's if it's pulling down in the back the weight of the clip so that's
why I was suggesting fz you could do it at any of them it's just that I think
it's more practical to use it at that fz side. Okay I was going to ask is is
there are there other things to that that default mode and network are useful for?
Or were you saying that's just for Parkinson's? It's not just for Parkinson's,
but I'll tell you, although I do sometimes, particularly with the photonic stimulator,
I'll use the over those those particular sites. I think the map is is probably the
better way to go until you've exhausted the possibilities with the map. And then,
you know, you want to try a different row. If you're early in treatment with
somebody, I would not go straight to the default mode network. Why? Not because it's
wrong, but it's not it's not harnessing the power of the strategy toward lifting the
suppression. So the reason we follow the gradient is because that suggests an easier
way to get the suppression to lift so hopping around the head in other ways is
ignoring the gradient and you might get things to move or you might not and you're
not going to know you're not going to know so I don't know if that answered your
question or not but yes thank you yeah I come trying to think when have I when
have I early on gone to the default mode network over following the site sort if
you guys think back about a year ago or actually more than that I have a client
who had a really catastrophic stroke I don't see her off and they can only come to
the office about once a month and sometimes they we have to do over the phone so
it's not always she's not always physically accessible to me but she had as a
result of the stroke she had a lot of confusion about where she was and she
thought her office was in her home and she it was like delusional almost but also
it was a disorientation to person and place and that's one of the major things the
default mode network handles it's that sense of self and the place in person and so
I did I did support that right away with the light on the head and that was sort
of pivotal in turning the tide on the delusion. That's the only word I have for it
is delusion. I don't I think it was maybe not like standard delusions but it
eventually it's resolved and she hasn't had this confusion in a long time. So the
default mode network was very useful for that, targeting that, but it was more with
the photonic stimulator than the lens. And it was with pretty long exposures.
When I'm doing it on the head like that, I'm doing three or four minutes at a
time on each site. So it's a long time holding that light over somebody's head. But
It was really creating a lot of angst in the family because they couldn't talk her
out of it and she couldn't let go of it. And so when that finally left and she
didn't have that confusion anymore, just the whole family harmony improved greatly.
So that was a good, it was a good call.
So Courtney, is there a application that a specific situation regarding that or you
were just asking in general? You have somebody in mind? Well I do have somebody
that just started and she's only she's only been with me one time and we did body
lens because her kids reached out and asked her to come and told me that she has
not been diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's but she has been for about 10 years.
She's staying the same, but just confused. She said she has a lot of symptoms of
it, but she's not getting worse. And so they're like, and she hasn't been diagnosed.
So I, you know, I'm, I am a little bit nervous to work with her,
I guess, because I don't want to, I don't know. I just really don't know what to
do. She She says she's going to schedule with me by the end of January. And so I
was just wondering if that is something that I would do, but it sounds like I
don't want to do that at first. I would try to get a map first within the
parameters of her sensitivity.
Sometimes the process of dementia renders people more durable is not the right word
but they're a little bit harder to shift and so they can take a little more. So
the people that I've worked with who were actively in dementia were they did have
reactivity but they were not my super sensitive. That could just be luck of the
draw you know I don't want to overgeneralize but there is something about head
injury and dementia that seems to render people kind of locked down.
In most cases, now sometimes you get like the the person who Galen just showed who
was you know who was hit at the stop sign with the car accident and though you
have that wild variability, sometimes you'll see that but more often what I've seen
is very low variability. And their presentation from day to day is pretty, you know,
pretty stable. I mean, it's confusion, but it's the same confusion day after day
after day. It's got a little bit different content. But when you look at the
process with that they're dealing with, it's the same old song, you know, it's same
song, different verse, I guess, is what you would say. So Courtney, do you have a
photonic or you might know I yeah I'm new I don't I don't have one I just have a
very cheap version of one I mean very very cheap what are the wavelengths that you
have I don't have it in front of me it's at the office so I'm not sure I'm gonna
look into that whenever I heard what you were saying to Rebecca earlier so I'm
gonna go look at that yeah but and Courtney when did you get your lens back in
March okay great listen there's nothing inherently tricky about people with dementia
their ability to tell you how they're affected is sometimes limited but we're here
with the call every week and happy to support you and your work with this
individual so you know keep coming back and raise your hand and get input and you
can probably do a lot of good there. Well thank y 'all so much. I love listening
to all of y 'all. You're just so full of wisdom. Yeah and now we turn to the wise
Rebecca Smith.
I appreciate all the wisdom I get on these calls because I tell you what I need
it. I was looking back at, if we can stay with the Parkinson's guy for a moment,
I was looking back at my notes and two things that I thought were worth mentioning.
One of his ankles is severely swollen and so we've done a lot of body lens and
that swelling has gone down. It's still somewhat swollen but I just wanted to
mention that and it's only on one side. And then most of this time I've been doing
100%. There was one time when I did 1%. And that day is when he was woozy,
had a dull headache. So that I think was getting to the head injury. And that's
when the boxing got harder. And he had a bicep twitching after that time. So part
of me too was wondering maybe, Even though it's discomfort.
That's not a bad those things aren't bad and maybe I need to switch Switch to 1 %
Because he was so bummed about the boxing how it got worse. I switched back to the
hundred percent but I'm wondering especially with Parkinson's if It's been like this
and we're looking for breakthrough versus if it's been like this and we're looking
for calm maybe I do go to the the 1 % and I was wondering if anyone had thoughts
on that.
Is his inner reactivity high?
Um
I
- Yes, but not external. - Okay, so that's the real benefit of the 100 % duty cycle,
right? When the reactivity is really high, with seizures, we see it with migraines,
we see it with conditions that are highly inflammatory. So there is an inflammatory
component to Parkinson's that accompanies that. That doesn't mean you wouldn't ever
use 1%. One of the ways that I sometimes use 1 % in situations where the person
does have some reactivity, but we need to mix it up, is to use 1 % for a longer
time. And then what you get is essentially a repetitive stimulus,
which has repeated stimulus over time, has a sedative effect.
You know, it's like listening to a boring conversation puts you to sleep. It's kind
of like it's no longer stimulating. It's just like the same thing over and over. So
I was thinking about your contemplating doing two channel with one over the sensory
motor strip and one over the shoulder. You could try that would be a reasonable
place to try something like that. Okay. What says it's a longer It's a little bit
longer exposure. Still watch the screen. What you're gonna watch for there is a
change in the way the dominant frequency is behaving. If it's really stuck when you
put it on, when you first start running it and you're gonna look for it to become
more variable, if it's really wild, you're gonna look for it to become better
controlled.
You're looking for more of - Mm -hmm, fair.
Thank you. - Something else for Parkinson's, especially thinking about the edemia in
one foot. Glutathione, I have a, this is Glutaryl.
It's a topical application of Glutathione. And this is with NAC,
NAC, and glycine, that's what we're going for with that combination of supplements.
And this is getting it direct with glutathione. It's hard to supplement orally 'cause
it's eliminated primarily the first pass. So this skips the first pass problem.
It's about $100 a month, but he could be interested in that too. I imagine, you
know, just a good, really good antioxidant with help.
I had a client with, have a client with muscular dystrophy get a lot of swelling
in his feet. When he first used this, the swelling went down really quickly. Can
you hold it up again, please? Sure. Glutarell.
Compound and Pharm Assist in LA developed it. I talked to him very interesting.
Thank you
Rebecca, did you want to discuss your other client? Yeah Two women with and I saw
the same thing happen body lens wise with the raw EEG on knee replacements.
And I hadn't really seen it before where it responded initially and then it
flatlined. And the dominant frequency was 0 .05.
And I just, is it 'cause it's not, you know, organic parts in there.
- What amplified it in Um, the neuro bit, uh,
so I just learned something about the neuro bit yesterday related to interference, so
I don't have a neuro bit, so I'll be relying on you to tell me, but I understand
it has an impedance meter that if you, if the impedance is too high, you're not
going to be able to get usable signal at all on the screen and it flat lines. So
that's what it does when the impedance exceeds a certain threshold. So my guess is
that something caused the impedance to go up and you got a flat line and then you
got that low oscillation. - Okay, 'cause interference on this system is diff,
like I've been surprised. Okay, so it looks different than the previous system.
- I don't know more about it than that other and I was just talking to Daphne and
she said, yeah, the neuro -bits, 'cause I had responded to somebody on the listserv
who I think probably now I think probably has a neuro -bit, not a A200,
which is what I have. So I had said yesterday, you know, maybe consider putting on
a filter for what they were doing. And then Daphne said, in their case, the neuro
-bit's gonna cut it off before it even gets to the issue of filtering, you don't
get usable signal. And I didn't know that. So I think that's so one thing I
noticed is sometimes the red light of interference will come on the device, but the
waves look fine. Uh huh. Is that a trash signal or is that still usable?
I'm guessing that if the computer if the if first of all there's a there may be a
delay between what's activating the light and what's showing up on the screen. I'm
not sure what the prime lag is there, but I think if you're seeing it on the
screen you're probably getting feedback.
If I am seeing it on the screen? Yeah, if you're seeing decent signal you're
probably good. Okay, okay. What you have what what definitely is you'll get a signal
that's not usable if it's you know the dealt it essentially takes the signal away
from the screen or shifts it to that very low oscillation if it's exceeding the
parameters of interference okay thank you very much sure
Can I ask my question? I'm trying to see who that is.
Oh, I have my hands dirty. Sure, go ahead. Um, quick question.
When do, do you ever use single channel body lens? And if so, when do you use it?
Sometimes you single -channel body lens. I don't do a lot of body lens myself, so I
don't really, for somebody who was,
I
don't know, I probably would now, I would probably mostly do two -channel body lens,
but can you tell me a a little bit where the question's coming from? Well,
I do single channel.
So I have a client who has a therapy dog. And the therapy dog was having anxiety.
And so we started doing single channel head, you know, headlands on the dog. He had
them go and see another lens provider first to get the whatever protocol they were
using. And they told me what they were using. and then I just continued to help
her. So just giving her a little help in the session and trying to help this dog
out.
Anyway, that's why I asked for the picture 'cause I kept struggling to remember to
switch back from single channel to double channel and remembering where, what goes
where. And they sent me the picture and then I saw the single channel body lens
and I thought, oh gosh, when would you ever use that? If you did, what's the point
of it even being an option?
There are some people who really don't like working with the wires and they just
use single channel It behaves a little bit differently than than to channel to
channel tends to be a little bit milder
Just very very slightly and so it's an option most people What I see is the trend
right now is that most people use two channel, but you don't have to. I was a
holdout on single channel for a long time, and honestly, I only started doing my
maps in two channel because everybody else was, and I wanted to understand how the
maps were affected by using two channels versus one. But for even as recently as
two years ago, I was still mostly doing single channel maps. Why? Because that's
just how I was doing them, and it was working fine. So, you can use one channel
or two channels.
It's probably simpler with a dog to use one channel.
Yeah, I do this on my head lens.
But yeah, I just saw the picture of it and was curious as to what it was for.
I do have a client who has some neuropathy in her hands and her feet. And when I
was in my class, we learned to first treat the issue in the body and then go up
to the brain. And so she also had some balance issues and some kind of like foot
dragging. I actually think she might have flu -garage disease. But I've been trying
to get her to go see the doctor. And she's gone to a neurologist a lot and they
just say neuropathy, that's it. But her ANA is high. And I think she's got some
sort of rheumatology issue going on and tried to push her to get to the doctor to
try to figure it out. But until then we did lens on her feet and she started
tripping less and started walking better and her hands have been freezing up and
locking and so we started doing lens on her hands and they stopped freezing up and
locking but the last time they she she got worse she was more depressed and her
hands She said not just my hand, but my whole arm was locking up.
So I'm assuming there's some sort of disease process going on in here. But any
advice on doing hands? Because I noticed the signal is quite high when you're trying
to do body lens on the hands. So I'm just curious. Let's back up to the arm
locking up. Did that pass? Yeah. Well, it'll last for a couple of hours and then
it'll let go. Okay. So Is it a recurrent symptom or is it something that happened
after you lensed her and then it went away after a couple of hours and didn't come
back? - We probably did lens on the hands three times and things were just getting
progressively better. On the fourth time, she had more symptoms,
but she also had a lot of emotional things going on. Husband wanting a divorce,
daughter's having a baby, big is so increased stress. Did she have old emotional
content rising to the surface concurrent with that?
You know I didn't ask that's a good thing to ask. It's possible that what you had
there was a motor symptom that was caught up in the release of suppression.
I can't say yeah I can't we won't know for sure but sometimes people have temporary
worsening that's associated with the lifting of suppression. And it's old stuff. And
it can be motor symptoms as well as emotional.
Okay, so kind of if you if you give it a little time and then you assess a few
days or a week or two weeks out, sometimes they're better off. And if it's the
release of suppression that was causing it, they will have an improvement. Okay,
so quick And Will, when I'm doing lens on the hands, is there any rule on whether
to do it on the bottom or the top? I do notice the red light coming on off and
on throughout the session, throughout the feedback because of the whatever's happening
in her hand. And she's sitting perfectly still. It looks like she's just relaxing,
no movement, but those signals are quite high. - Muscles can create their own
interference and you've got a lot of muscle that's tight there in the hands.
My guess is that it's changing in the muscle tension that would be causing that
interference but I don't know for sure. There's not a rule as far as the palm of
the hand versus the top of the hand. I would say, you know, I personally think the
top of the hand is a little easier to get the sticker to life flat but you know
I've also worked on hands by having people just hold a flat electrode between their
fingers and it was effective so it's even though we we sort of honor some
acupuncture points by putting a sensor over them the effect appears to be a little
broader okay Adam says what should the signal look like when using body lens?
Well, it should look like usable signal, Adam, but a lot of times it doesn't,
just because what I was saying about the muscles. So it often will be a fuzzier
signal. I think on the neuro -bit, it sounds like the neuro -bit cuts in and out
based on the interference that pops in and out. I was really grateful that Nicole
was able to steer you toward that picture on the neuro -bit since I don't have one
I can't show you. But the signal for body lens often is messier than the signal
for head lens.
And that's one of the things that you can watch for because the signal will become
clearer as you go along and the interference drops away. The signal will look
better. I know that still doesn't give you a picture of it and I'm sorry for that,
but
>> Thank you for answering the questions. I did want to know one thing with the
hands and the feet. Is there a max amount of feedback to give? Is there -- how
much can I give? >> It's based on the sensitivity, reactivity, and hardiness of your
client. >> So is there a point where you say, okay, I'm at 200 seconds of body
lens? Maybe I should go to to the head instead?
I think it depends on whether you're still getting results. Okay. If you're still
getting good changes and good relief then
I would let the gains add up over time. If what you're getting is temporary relief
and it keeps slipping back to where it was before, which sometimes you can if there
are progressive conditions Um, you might just explore what different effect you might
get by working on the head.
I do mostly head lens, so I'm going to have a bias in that regard, um,
just because that's what I do. So just know that. It doesn't mean that you can't
get where you want to go using body lens. I would exhaust the possibilities of
either and then add the other,
so. So, let's see, we're just about to the end of our time.
We have time for one more quick question.
Let's see if anybody has-- Can I ask about the site map with the amplitude?
I've read a few different things. Should, whenever I'm looking at that, to decide
where people are at? Should it be between 5 and 17 .5 for amplitude?
It's not a goal. Okay. It's just where it usually ends up. Okay.
And then, but frequency, is there a goal there in what children?
Is it different? It is different with children because the brain is not mature and
so there are developmental trends that you'll see young children and by young I mean
under the age of 10.
frequencies. So we're fortunate that we don't really have to worry about that too
much with lens. We're really mostly looking at the suppression, right? So the
developmental piece is kind of cooked into all of that.
But you're not going to see somebody with a dominant frequency of, you know, 14
over the motor strip when they're five years old.
the brain has to be able to coordinate its energy to produce those higher
frequencies, and that's dependent on the physical maturation of the organ.
So great question, Christy. Lisa. I'm having some of my materials that the normal
limits on amplitude is 13 to 18, and so I always draw that on my map and just
see how much I've got above or below it. And then I think normal limits on
frequency is alpha range because you've got your eyes closed. So it should come up
alpha. And I always draw that line on my map and I just see what's above and
what's below it. Just, I don't know, it's a guideline. Well,
I think it's nice to have like a mental reference, but the reality is a lot of
people will feel good and they'll launch before they fall in those parameters. Oh
yeah, I don't, it's not a goal. I don't expect a person to get in it. It's just,
it tells me a little bit about, well, this is kind of considered normal and let's
see what, what this looks like. Yeah, I often draw the tin hurts on my,
on mine as well.
Betty, you had something >> Yeah, I wanted to ask you if you've spoken any about
the map reading class. >> You know what? I was just talking with Daphne yesterday
about the firming up the date. So, but I want you guys to know what I'm
envisioning for the first class is a small group class that will be closed to the
participants so that we can have the comfort and privacy of question asking.
I love this format that we have here. Many people don't wanna be on a recording
that other folks are listening to after the fact asking questions or whatever. So I
don't know whether people who are really experienced with lens as you are Betty and
you are Christie, whether that's gonna be something that you'll want to do, but it's
structured as a six week series and we're just trying to finalize the date and time
slot right now. Okay please count me in. Okay and I'm happy to run,
I'm happy to run multiple sections of it but I want to keep it smaller because we
talk about the maps quite a bit in our Tuesday talks but a lot of folks still
have questions that They're just not they just need more so Anyway,
we've come to the end of our time Courtney and Jack. I'm so sorry We didn't get
to you if you want to send me an email if it's pressing feel free to just shoot
me a message Otherwise, we'll we'll take you next week. And I'm sorry. We don't
have time for for you today No, just being happy new year and thank you Lisa Yes,
Yes in coming in on that smoke of that class as well Okay. All right,
everybody. Have a great week. We'll see you next time. Happy new year"

""Getting More from Your Lens."" I'm your facilitator, Dr. Lisa Merrifield. You can
call me Lisa. And I want to welcome you to this hour of sharing and consulting and
puzzling and just generally being together with other Lens clinicians.
So it's nice to see you here. I'd like to pull the group to see who among us has
a real -time clinical need. We are going to pick up with Cheryl from last week.
She sent me her map, so we were talking about her at the very end. Allison, you
have your hand up.
Is it a question or is it a case that you wanted to discuss?
More a question but it is a case.
Is it something where you want to show maps and that kind of thing or is it okay
why don't we go ahead and start with that it sounds less involved. Yeah so I'm
looking at potentially taking on a 10 year old with panic disorder and I just
wanted to have a quick rundown of working with kiddos and lens again if possible.
Yeah. What is your um can you say a little bit more about what you're wondering
about?
Well just like um just general information for like I just don't really know exactly
what I'm doing. If that makes sense like with um like treating adults versus
treating kids I know can be different. And so the mom seems pretty sold.
She's pretty excited about the idea of me working with her kiddo with lens. And
we're gonna do some behavior stuff too, but we thought this would be a good way to
couple just correcting some of what's already been happening. And so I guess one of
the questions I have is like duration and if like treatment like dosage is fairly
similar with kids or should I be even more cautious with kids and dipping the toe
in typically or just follow the normal recipe of like okay how sensitive are they
how as a general rule the younger children are more sensitive part of that this
relates to, I think, probably brain architecture, that the brain is still developing.
By the time you get to 10, you're in a different phase. It's like, if you look at
PSJA's stages between nine and 10, they're moving into a different, you know, it's
because the brain is changing. So you're not dealing with an organism that's quite
um default sensitive do just do the assessment and a lot of times with the with
the kids body lens can be a great way to start I say that based on what other
people tell me I haven't had a kid where I've started a body lens in a long time
so I usually start on the head but many clinicians feel more comfortable starting on
the body and you still get a good result so I'll just pass that along.
The panic disorder falls under the anxiety disorders, you know,
in psychology and the DSM. In the lens world,
it falls under core 8. So that's really the distinguishing thing as far as lens
goes. So you want to keep that in mind, the high reactivity and the sort of
surprise nature of some of those episodes. And so when we say treat with Core 8 in
mind, we're really talking about the duty cycle to start with. And then once you
started working with somebody, of course you proceed based on their reactions and
there are some people with Core 8 where they do better on the 1 % duty cycle and
that's just how it is. But the general starting point for somebody with core 8 in
terms of duty cycle is to start with 100. If the person is very sensitive you can
raise the offset.
A lot of times people
will use that 4 second 100 % mapping application to start and I think mentally the
idea of a high offset gives me a lot of it seems to give me some peace of mind
we don't really know what changing the offset does in terms of the what's going on
but as a general rule the higher offsets seem to be a little um milder in terms
of their effect so you know but the the before you do any of this you got to
meet with the child and see what you think you know sort of compare them to other
people you've worked with. Has the mother had lens herself? - No,
but she's very interested in maybe also having some lens just to see what it's
like. She said she's very scientifically minded. So I'm not completely sure what will
happen our first sessions today. So. - Well, what will happen is lots of questions.
So get ready. Yeah, that is okay. I like you when they're curious because then we
get to give them all of the information and they don't go Google it. Yeah. Well,
and you know, when you've got a curious client, it puts you in a great
collaborative space and you can both be curious. And that's nice because then you're
not responsible for being the fortune teller you know you said well let's see
there's one way to find out you know but anyway that sounds good other things
related to working with children we have probably have other clinicians on the call
who can speak to just the practicalities of younger folks at 10 you've probably got
somebody who can sit if if they're if panic is the only thing that they're dealing
with you've probably got somebody who can sit in the chair you know unassisted um
If it's a fidgety kid, you might give them something to do with their hands while
you're getting them hooked up, you know, and then you can take it away when you're
ready to do the run. Yeah.
Perfect. Yeah. Maybe give her something. That's great knowledge because I've never
worked with a kid with lens before. So yeah, I was just kind of looking for tips
and tricks and all them goodies. So this is great. Let's see if anybody else has
suggestions for you. We had a couple of hands up. So let's just check and see.
Cheryl and Betty, did you have anything for Allison related to working with kids?
Oh, Cheryl. - Well, hi. - Hi, hi.
- But if mom's there and I don't know if you said this yet and if you did, I
apologize. I hook mom up so the kid can see mom's waves and I tell her to squint
her eyes and giggle and breathe heavy and they sit and they play with it for a
while till they're laughing and then I attack. Oh that's a great idea I love that
playful response.
Yeah kids are I'm very eager to help their parents,
too.
I've had kids where they took turns pressing the button for me. Everybody's gathered
around, because dad had an explosive-- he had seizure disorder and explosive temper.
So they were like, everybody's here to help dad. So I was like, oh, who wants to
push the button? And they were very happy to play a part in that.
So - It's a great suggestion, Cheryl.
- I was going to give you a suggestion. I mean, she didn't tell them to giggle,
but.
- Betty, you had something for Allison? - Yeah, I was just going to share, I've been
doing lens with a 10 year old and his dad, I've been doing lens with his dad for
quite a while. And I have asked him to help. He's extremely bright,
the 10 -year -old. And so I hooked up the dad and then I asked him,
like Lisa said, to sort of help and push the button or whatever, but or to check
the impedance or that kind of thing. And then I found that doing body lens on the
10 year old before I did head lens so I set him down he I did body lens across
his shoulder maybe a total of 44 seconds to 22 second times and it really calmed
his nervous system down quite a bit and he could sit stiller.
Then he had been able to, if I hadn't done the body lens first, but and then I
was able to do a couple of, using a two -channel, do a couple of sites.
Maybe I did six sites.
So yeah, I find that the body lens with the kids that I see to do that first is
helpful.
Wonderful. Thank you. I just love hearing everybody's.
My co -therapist is a big turtle puppet. And I have hooked him up and we've talked
to him about lens.
- Oh, that's a great way to do it too, especially if they're nervous.
Oh, good luck. Thank you. It should be an interesting session today with this kiddo.
- Christy, you had a comment. - I'll give you something for you, Allison. - Yeah. Go
ahead, Christy. - Okay, thanks, Galen. Yeah, all I was gonna add is that I keep a
clipboard and I keep
crayons or dry markers and pictures for the kids to color and then I also use the
hidden figures from highlights where they find the hidden figures. So I just keep
them sitting calmly in the chair because they have some activity that's of interest
and they get a lot of praise from mom and me about what they're doing. Oh that's
a great idea too. Something to fidget with
- Who thinks we're moving? - I have a little stool that's about two inches high.
I made out of a cardboard box and skyrofoam. So to make sure their feet can touch
the ground if they sit in the chair. But that's for everybody. I've got one 10
-year -old I've been working with. I worked with grandma before and mom doing therapy.
I did talk therapy with this ten -year -old before actually probably she was eight
the first time I did lens she first wanted to see mom or Grandma have it done and
then the next time I saw her We did body lens a couple times just to sess out
how sensitive she was and
Head lens never over treated her And the first time I think she was,
it's in the evening before dinner, she was really, really hungry.
And the same thing happens if someone's really tired, they'll feel really sleepy. But
that seems to be really consistent. If someone hasn't eaten recently, now they know
they need to eat.
And it - - So snacks. (laughing) So snacks, that's a good thing now a snack.
Yeah, I'd be good to have a snack ahead of time But yeah, but that's just a
matter of lifting
Suppression lifting
Dissociation and it usually she's pretty she's very volatile. She's a really good
student always good at school But at home a lot of chaos and it ""Quiet's down,
helps her sleep.""
- Oh, that's nice.
- Daphne.
- Renees.
- Hi there. Hi there, this is Daphne. It doesn't allow me to raise my hand because
I'm listed as an organizer on this, so sorry I kind of do this visually.
There's, Dr. Christine Durfee did a webinar several years ago on working with
children for anybody that's interested in that. I think it's in the web store.
There's also Melissa Jones who is out of Texas will be joining us in January or
February also talking about working with children. So look for that if that's
something of interest to you that'll be coming out in the next newsletter and you
could read about what she'll be discussing and whatnot. So I want to let everybody
know that.
Great great reminder of the pre -recorded session Okay,
I'm surveying Cheryl. They see you're waving your
mic is turned off.
Sorry. I sent you yet email my map Yes,
I just downloaded them right before I logged on. So if Daphne, for some reason I'm
frozen on the screen so I don't know what that means about my internet here but
it's it's I'm on a hard connection. It should be fine. So anyway Daphne,
if you could give me permission to share my screen.
Let's see here.
All right.
We can see your screen excellent. Thank you for that confirmation
Here let me get to the first one. I've got Apparently I got more copies than I
realized with some of these. That's okay All right, they're all the same. They all
look the same Well, but this 503 was the first number so okay let's see I put the
oldest ones in I downloaded the old like the order that the emails came in this
one said it was an older map yeah let's see okay so Cheryl for people who were
not on the call last week could you quickly recap a little bit about your situation
and your history, your sensitivity, that kind of thing, just so people know something
about your characteristics.
- What are we supposed to be seeing here?
- Yeah, we're not seeing my map. - You're not, okay, well, you were seeing the
screen. All right, let's see. - Does Yahoo Mail login? - No, that's not it.
I'll just go ahead while you're doing that. Yeah, so you guys are not seeing the
open map on the. No, no, Lisa, I think it's probably frozen,
the same as your screen is frozen, your picture is frozen, so is the Yahoo mail is
frozen.
Dang.
Okay.
Well,
let me see. I can go to the basement and reset the router.
That will be fairly disruptive. I don't know if that's gonna solve the problem.
Well, we're still hearing your voice just fine. Yeah. Right. I wonder if it would
make sense for you to check in again. Okay, I'll try that.
Okay, it says my mic is my mic is on.
There's no picture. Can you just leave and then come back?
I did leave and now I'm coming back. Okay, but usually it shows your picture of
yourself before you come on. Nothing right. And we see a still picture.
That's the one that got frozen.
Too bad it wasn't a picture.
Hi Lisa's Daphne, it looks like you're logged in twice when I look at the list of
people. Really? All right, well, good now.
And it sounds like you're logged in twice.
Okay, you're down to one time now. But I'm frozen, so I'm getting out again.
definitely why won't she goes out that picture doesn't disappear why is that you
know what I wish I had answers Betty it doesn't make sense to me and there might
have been a little confusion because it looked like there was a that do a login
now she's gone there she went away that's a good sign yeah Yeah
All right, thank you guys Appreciate your patience with that now Daphne.
Let's try it again. I think you'll need to give me permission to share again
All right, where did my-- Del, let's go.
They're still here.
Del, they're still there. All right, now,
On my screen, I'm seeing a photograph of a map.
No. No? No. No.
We see the screen that says Lens Tuesday weekly webinar. Where you join on Yahoo
Mail. Yeah, that is the actual, that's my mail.
No, we don't see the maps So you're not seeing my what's on my screen, right?
Because that's what I'm seeing on my screen has the I think the Let me get
The window that you're sharing could you give me permission to share again, please?
Please.
Alright, we're sharing a window.
Are you still seeing the email or are you seeing the map the email?
So on the screen that I'm looking at, I have the option to stop sharing, which is
why I'm thinking that I'm sharing with you, but I'm Clearly not Lisa.
What would happen if you shrunk what that screen? I mean if you Shuck it down.
Let's see. Yeah, let's see what's behind it
All right, so on my screen, what's in the middle now says Anywhere Access.
Is that what you're seeing?
No, it's again the a Tuesday weekly webinar series.
- There's that, all right.
Daphne, if we gave you the control of this, would you do any better, do you think?
Is there something that you're Thinking of that. I'm not you know great question and
what I'm wondering is I can bring it back to me and you send it back to you But
when I bring it back to me if you could close every screen besides the one you
want to share Before you hit share screen and let's see what happens. Does that
sound like a plan? It does I think that'll leave me closing go -to -training though.
That's my concern
Okay, I can close out of Yahoo email.
Yeah, that you can close out of-- put the map on the screen.
Let me just bring this over here. I have the map on the screen now. OK, so let
me go ahead and switch here.
So when it selects, when you're on the screen that says select content you want to
share one of them says entire screen. Yes. Okay. And that's the one you're clicking.
I've been clicking on window and then it changes the thing that's in the middle
square and I highlight that and then I click on share. Try clicking on the entire
screen. should be your desktop. Let's see what happens with that. I'm going to go
and send it back to you.
Here we're modeling the spirit of curiosity.
Right I have go to training open and I have my email open. I've closed out of the
pictures
Y 'all are still there and go to training good
There's my permission to share. All right. I'm clicking. I want to share email
entire screen and
Also system audio
Clicking on share
So is So can you minimize the go -to training so you're not going to see everybody,
but we're seeing your desktop it looks like. Is it possible to minimize the go -to
training?
And then it looks like we are in that screen to sign in to go -to training.
If it's possible to minimize that one or close it all together.
OK, now we're back to your desktop. So go ahead and bring up that map, please.
So we're looking at Yahoo! Mail right now with the invitation. There's our mail.
There we go. There we go. - Yay, you got it.
We can't hear you.
Your mic is off Lisa
there, okay now
We're gonna hear you on but the map's gone. Oh my sweet lord
All right, on my screen, I'm seeing Cheryl's oldest math data.
Okay. Okay. Now, Cheryl, let's have you give a recap of your situation so that
people who have not been on the call before will have a sense of what we're doing
here, and then we'll move forward. Okay. I have one 10, in sensitivity,
I have a history of severe abuse as a child,
as well as nine concussions.
The concussions are intermittent of some of these maps. I've actually had two,
one when I think the old I think right before this and I use the lens for a year
and then I hit again. But nothing has changed. I have tried everything.
I've tried to double it where you go to four, six, eight, ten and have been on it
for a half an hour with answers on 0102.
I went to Mike at the advanced training and he did 282 program.
I've tried minimal seconds. I've gone through pretty much the whole gamut.
I've been working with Daphne and we've been experimenting for about a year. I don't
think there's any application I haven't tried. I am not anxious,
so you can do anything to me. I don't feel anything.
However, I have been improving with symptoms.
My memory was of great concern and losing words and the brain fog.
And that's pretty much all gone now, but I sure would like to live in some alpha
to see what it's Sure
So I just that the first maps and the last maps a year and a half later are
pretty close to identical Well, that other one nothing's moving Let's pull up that
other map. You said that was the last one
Yeah What the the first one I sent you was the last one I did Okay,
that was on one one percent of four seconds The first ones I sent they're all
mishmash. I don't know what the applications were, but nothing, nothing is moving.
- Well, okay, for one thing, if you want to understand how things are changing,
you gotta use the same application from time one to time two. Otherwise, you're
gonna get an artifact in there that's a reflection of the application you're using.
There's just no way around that. When you run them longer, it looks different. So
it's not so much a problem what the application is, although the more disruptive
applications are going to give you a standard deviation that looks a lot more. They
just stir things up more. So you're better off, for mapping purposes,
to use something that's a relatively mild application like 2 seconds,
100%, or 4 seconds, 100 % with a high offset or whatever,
but if you're trying to understand how your map is changing, do not change the
applications. Okay, that's good to know. We are only seeing theta.
Yeah, and you see how big the scale is there? That's what I'm not really
understanding there, because it's not showing any.
I think it would look different if your scale was closer to where the measurements
are. And usually in order to get the scale that high, one of the measurements was
super high, but I'm not seeing that on your, I'm not seeing anything suspect for
that on your site sort. Can I jump in for a second here? This is Daphne. So the
way that the mapping works on this is, so we are just looking at theta and so
when the software is printing out the map if we look at it we've got the mean
dominant frequency then all the rest are amplitudes we've got the mean total
amplitude mean dominant frequency and then you have the sub bands okay the delta
theta alpha low beta beta and high beta so what the software does is it will take
all of the amplitude data and scale each of those, even the subbands,
to the same scale, which is going to be hinged on the highest amplitude on whatever
scale it showed up. So we don't have the ability to just go into theta, for
example, and rescale just theta. It will scale to the highest amplitude in whatever
band it was in. I sent you all of them. The first, right in that grouping is the
dominant frequency so it's another map that I sent I got three three maps that
sound right Cheryl no I sent quite a few more but let's see
Yeah, here's it has to be a this is a different map here. It's got to be because
they look at the theta It's from a different date
Well ends I mean I mean, this is not the first map, right? But we saw the first
map, we saw the mean total amplitude and the mean dominant frequency. This is a
different map and the amplitudes in Delta are higher than they were on the first
map. So there was some change.
I think when you say there's not any change you're referring to, when you look at
it, you're not seeing more blue.
And When we see your theta band here, clearly in the theta band,
the standard deviation has come back in. So I think you're not,
because of the scaling of what you're looking at, you're maybe not able to see it.
When you look at the subbands, you can see this is clearly changing.
Would it be possible Cheryl, would it be possible for you to call into headquarters
and get them to walk you through making a PDF of the maps and just send me,
just send me all your map data and then let me mess with it so we can find a
better way to look at it. That would be awesome. But I will say Cheryl, it's not
going to be, it's actually not going to tell you all that much if you were
changing up the applications like you're not going to know whether what you're
looking at is because you've changed or because you changed the application so before
you go to a bunch of work to do that I've just you know you got to decide how
satisfying that's going to be for you it may not be satisfying well what so just
go to 100 % at two seconds and stay >> If you feel like the problem is that
you're not moving, do you have -- I know you said only 110 and sensitivity, what
is that -- what is the sensitivity that you have? >> I don't -- it was being
around other people who -- judging their appearance. I don't judge appearance.
- Do you know which one that is?
- It's the question about I judge my friends based on how it feels to be with them
rather than their appearance. - Yes. - Yeah. - Yeah. And that's a 10, so you're more
feeling oriented. - Yeah. - There. - Okay. - And that was the only 10.
- Okay.
So I think The two percent a hundred two second a hundred percent would be a
fairly safe application for you to try to do a map Okay, or you can go with the
old standard map. It's you know, just the one percent. How do you do on one
percent? It doesn't I don't do any different with any of them.
I don't feel it. I don't feel like I change I'm not aware of any change anything
in the list brighter louder nothing I just have noticed over time.
I've been keeping track of losing things and I'm not losing things anymore and I
have my words back. Well that's really good Cheryl. Yeah but I
don't feel anything from any of it. And you may never.
So because some of us just don't notice and don't have that reaction to what's
going on. I have some clients that notice every single run I do.
That is, you know, if I if I move the next time, Yeah, if I run it for four
seconds, they feel it. I run a different site four seconds, they feel it or feel
something else. Yeah, I know. I don't notice the same issue.
I'm not noticing things when I do it to myself. So, yeah, I don't know how to
explain that. But I think that's, it's always been that way.
And, you know, feeling is its own domain when it comes to the lens, the felt
experience, that kind of feeling, but feeling like things are changing or having a
cognitive awareness that things are better. It's almost like that's a little bit of
a different axis, right? There's an intellectual understanding that things are
changing. You're not feeling the process,
- Right, but so you're not getting shifted in the moment. It's kind of like with
anxiety when we talk about state and trade anxiety, you know? - Right. - People with
state anxiety have, they can lose it right away and they'll feel different. But
people who are not carrying a high load of anxiety often do not report a shift in
the moment in the same way that the anxious people will. So in a lot of ways
anxiety can be a it's a convenient symptom, I think for me because you know often
they can you can see them relax in the chair Somebody who's not carrying that
tension. It's sometimes you you do the lens and you go well see you next week and
we'll see what happens
So we've got a couple of different ways we could go with this Cheryl and I'm
willing to help you either way and I want it to be your choice. I think it's
going to be a lot of work to go through and compile all your maps from what
you've done before, but if you want to do that and you want to look it over, we
can do that. We can either do it on the call or I'll do it with you on the
side. Thing is, the standard deviation information in particular is not really going
to be applicable anymore because it's so affected by the applications.
We might be able to see a trend in the amplitudes and the dominant frequency, just
the black aspect of the measurements.
And so we could do that, or we could just have you start with getting a fresh
map. And then after you finish that map, get another map.
Just do two maps in succession. two maps in succession. - Okay. - And if you wanna
take a couple of weeks in between or you wanna take a month in between, it doesn't
matter. But we'll look at both of the maps and we'll see how they're changing. But
use the same application for both of them. And it can be the standard map
application. It could be map two second, a hundred percent, which you're not high
-reactivity so I don't think going with something that's longer is really going to be
necessary or all that helpful.
What would you recommend for time in between my sessions?
Can I
I don't I think that might be a little much. Okay, I would do what you do your
own map or will you have somebody do it for you? No, I'll do it Okay, so so when
you're doing the lens you're always doing it on yourself. Yes Okay, so that's
another Potentially another aspect of why your maps look a little bit different most
of the maps We look at are done by a clinician with a person in the chair, right?
So we use those, we use those names to kind of designate who's putting the
electrodes, who's doing the application and who's getting measured, you know?
If you had somebody who could come and stand with you and you could hook yourself
up and close your eyes and they could push the button for you, like maybe your
husband could help you, you might see your map look different. It's pretty clear to
me now that with many people, the measurements will look different on the screen
when you've got somebody right up close to them. And it's some kind of biofield
effect. But that may be one of the reasons why your maps are looking a little
different as well, because you're doing them to yourself. I've done a lot of maps
on myself. It's not a bad thing, but our question is why aren't your maps changing
like most of the maps usually change? And that could be one element of it. So
let's bring another person into the mix and see if your maps behave a little more
typically. How often?
I'd give it at least a week in between. And how many sites per session um let
me ask you this would you be would you be happier treating more frequently yeah i
i would like to do this and see what happens okay it doesn't matter or you know
if i could do a bunch of sites at once if you want to treat more frequently then
uh do seven at a time are you gonna do two channel or one channel. Two. Okay.
Do okay. If it's two channel, two channels a little milder. Whatever you want me to
do, I'll try. Yeah, I know, but I really don't have a clear sense of where your
threshold is. I know you say that nothing affects you. That doesn't mean that we've
figured out where the sweet spot is in terms of dosing. No, we haven't. So The
good news is you've had improvement. I would like to avoid doing too much. It
sounds like a full map would probably be okay for you.
Here's what I'm going to suggest. Do the standard map, the 1 % duty cycle standard
map.
Do a whole map, wait a week, do another map. Do this between now and when we
reconvene in the new year, okay, and you should have three maps
1 % a whole map wait a week and do another one wait a week and do another one
Yes, and use the same order of application To the sites follow the same order
because it matters. So you don't want me to start on the left and go to the
right? Nope. I want you to use whatever order you use to capture the first map.
I want you to use the same order when you capture the second and the third map.
Okay. One percent for how long? How many seconds?
Are you on your lens computer now? No, okay. Let me pull mine up and see what I
have for standard map. I think I have one percent of four seconds
I've got to pull up my application Cheryl. Just give me a second here
Okay,
all right So
I do have to add that I I do other stuff as well I have a BRT that I'm on
every night and for the past month I've been doing David Delight.
It's in training.
Okay well I know what David is and and that's fine.
If you're wanting to understand how the maps are changing though it's gonna be I
won't do that. Well, I mean you can do it, but you got to you got to be sure
you do it the whole way through So if you're gonna if you're gonna do David
delight don't do David delight on the day That you do your maps don't do it before
you do the maps Okay, if you're gonna do it that day do it later in the day so
that you wake up after having been asleep and You do you do your map?
Oh, okay? All right, All right. Because a good night's sleep with entrainment, a lot
of times with a good night's sleep, you know, the entrainment will sort of
consolidate to the degree that it's going to, you'll have less of a David effect on
your map. Okay. All right. So... I guess I'm not clear.
What are you wanting to accomplish? I would like to see what it's like to live in
alpha because i'm in survival mode in delta
lens may not you may need more than lens well she's doing more than lens yeah so
you know we've got like Bernice's had her had an issue she didn't get to at all
here so we're running out of time
Hi, I'm sorry. I don't know if I should go or not, but I just have a quick
question. Yeah, go ahead. I just wanted to ask, I recently got the lens machine and
so I barely did my first map. I just wanted to know, like,
am I supposed to be sending the map somewhere? Where do I do because I have no
idea.
Okay, so this is your own map, Bernice? No, it's not my map.
I did one of my brother and one of my son who have been getting lens treatment
for a while, but they were just doing it with a different clinician. But now that
I got the machine, I'm doing them. I did it on my own. Okay. When you look at
the maps, look at the top two lines and see which of those lines has less blue,
fewer sites that have a blue cap, and then follow the order of the sites from left
to right, start at the left end of the site sort, and that's going to be your
sensor replacement from left to right okay yes
okay and then and then make note of any improvements or changes that they experience
anything that's different okay
so do you know how many sites the the person who was doing lens on them before.
Do you know, did they tell you what protocol they were using, what application? Yes,
they passed on the applications, but for the most part they were just doing like
the basic four -second the standard app.
Okay, Were they experiencing changes with that application? Not my son.
So for example, my son has already gotten a really, he's 14. He's already gotten a
really good amount of, he started in the summer and pretty consistently once a week.
And he still has almost all his sites are like very suppressed and not a whole lot
of changes.
But but then also with the other clinician, her machine was always kind of weird.
Like sometimes we would do the sides, but then they would not pop up and we had a
lot of issues with the machine throughout. So we weren't sure if it was the machine
not doing it correctly or what, but I'm hoping that now we'll kind of figure that
out. - Were his symptoms improving?
He has said that sometimes he'll notice some little changes, like for example, he
has dyslexia and one of the things he noticed is being able to pay more attention,
like in school and in sports, so as far as focus and attention, it would improve
for a little bit. And then he would kind of be like, ""Hey, I think I need another
session,"" because he would feel
Like he would go back to the same. I don't know. That's what he would tell me But
yeah, he did notice some improvement good, okay This is very much like Cheryl's
situation where she says she doesn't feel the effect of the lens But she can see
the effects of the lens in her Performance like her. She you know her she she
knows her memories better because she's not losing things as much With your son,
it sounds like he felt like he was doing better with his schoolwork. Were his
grades improving? His grades have been pretty okay. I think I think where he also
noticed that a little bit more was in sports because he was telling me like when
he was When in sports like he just felt like he was able to pay more attention
like in the game and in practice and be more present rather than,
like, distracted? Yeah. So it sounds like part of the question that you have is
really the dosing issue, and whether or not continuing with what the other clinician
was doing is going to give you the result that you were looking for. I would say
before you change the dose, just follow the site sort on the map that you have
just done. Okay. See what you notice. You live with him so you have more
opportunities for observation. Yeah. And if you don't after like a week goes by you
don't see anything better or different or he doesn't seem brighter or whatever then
the dose may need to be adjusted but you're not going to know that yet because you
haven't done it. So yeah just use the application that the other other clinician was
using, do it yourself and see how he responds. - Okay. Sounds good.
I will do that and then my other question was, do I need to be sending the maps
of what I'm doing to someone? I'm not sure if. - No. You're going to read the map
yourself or you're going to get help with reading the map. - Okay. - The most
important thing about the maps is that they Give some kind of structure to a what's
essentially a nonlinear process, you know, it gives us a way to understand better
how we're shifting things so you can use either sometimes people use the frequency
site sort because that's where the suppression is greater. Sometimes they use the
amplitude site sort because that's where the suppression is greater, but pick the one
that that has more sites that don't have much blue. - Yeah,
yeah, the less blue. Okay, I would do that. And then my other question is what do
I do? For example, in the last session, we put the electrode and while it was
running, it fell off and I had no idea what to do. What do you do when that
happens? - You can go into the software, there's a place let me pull this up
because I'm I'm on the I've
got my lens up are you seeing my lens software now hold on my it doesn't let me
no no the answers now okay come back here we're still looking at Cheryl's maps oh
You're not screen -sharing right now.
I've got so many little tiles open in front of me I'm trying to decide which one
to click on I'm gonna close out Cheryl's maps
Now this one if I go out with the last
This is Daphne, I'm going to jump in for a moment. I want to clarify the mapping.
So there's two maps that everybody has access to. One is the standard map. When you
go into the software, you select your patient. It's a yellow button. The other one
is an orange button that says suppression. If you're opting to use the standard map,
you'll always use the mean total amplitude left to right. If you're opting to use
the mean total amplitude, which is the one that shows up at the very top. If
you're opting to use the suppression map, you have your choice between the mean
total amplitude suppression map site sort or the mean dominant frequency suppression
map site sort. Generally, the selection would be if you're using that site sort,
whichever one has the most orange bars. But especially when you're new to the lens,
highly recommend. Just go ahead and make it real easy use the standard map. Okay,
the one that has black bars with the blue caps. And then just follow the very
first one that shows up the mean total amplitude. Follow it left to right. Okay.
The physiology of the person. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Just want to clarify that for
everybody. Okay. Thank you.
- Daphne, I think I have to ask you to give me a different permission to share
because it's switched to a different screen. I'm not sure if
that's possible. - Daphne, I just want to let you know that the lens is really good
for helping to resolve dyslexia. - I know,
And that's what I was hoping it would help the most with because he does struggle
with that a lot. So, yes, right. Thank you. It's really, it's really good. Yeah.
Thank you.
Can somebody tell me what you're seeing on your screen now?
No, we're not seeing Yeah, we're not seeing your screen at all What are you seeing
though? We're seeing just my original screen the cameras
Cameras Daphne, can you send me permission to share again?
Okay, you should have it.
I do not have it. So that's okay. I'm going to go back.
I'm going to just try to find the screen where I can see everybody to wrap it up.
For needs, there are ways to edit the data file to get rid of that data,
and there are ways to reset the software so that if an electrode falls off,
just repeat the measurement.
Even if you have to get out of the file and go back in so that you can label it
correctly, for right now, just do that. Okay, so exit out and then come back in
and select the same. Yes. Okay, I can do that. I just, I have no idea what to
do, so I was like, oh, okay. Well, you're figuring it out, So this is good.
- Thank you. - Bernice, one of the things that I do when the mean amplitude comes
up, I write down those sites on another piece of paper so that I know the order
in which I'm going to treat. And then if one of the sites falls
and I want to repeat it, then I have to reset that head where there's a real
reset button on the head that has all of the, so that you're going to lose
an awareness of the sites that you've already done. But reset it,
and then you'll have that list already on another piece of paper, So you'll know
the order in which you're gonna do it. - Okay, yeah, I'll keep tracking another
sheet of paper just in case then, thank you. - Right, right, right. - Yeah, thank
you.
- Okay, everybody, we're at the end of our hour. I'm seeing your pretty faces. I
don't know what you're seeing, but-- - Yes, me too. - I'm feeling a little bit
victorious here 'cause that was gnarly, That's a lot of pains. I hope you have a
wonderful holiday and I look forward to seeing you all in a new year. Okay. Happy
holidays too. Thank you everybody. Bye bye."

I'm trying to
change the word from webinar to seminar because somebody told me recently when you
hear webinar you think it's a sales demonstration so although we so I'm gonna switch
it to seminar but it's still online same same lovely service you've come to
appreciate so welcome everybody glad to have you with us. We've had one person write
in with something to share and before we get going with that that's Laura. Let me
just poll the group and see who on the call might have a real -time clinical need
or something that we need to be sure to get to today so I can put you in the
lineup. Just raise your hand on the camera or you can raise it virtually either way
is fine.
Okay, don't everybody raise your hand at once
Well, you know what that means things are going well for folks and that's good news
so Laura without further ado. Let me back up and say welcome to this week's
Installation of our weekly web seminar getting more from your lens. I'm your
facilitator Dr. Lisa field you can call me Lisa. This is our hour to discuss the
wonderful products of Oaks Labs and that is the lens and the photonic stimulator and
we're interested in anything about these products that has you excited, has you
curious, has you scratching your head about how to help a client. We'd like to talk
about it here. So feel free, it's an interdisciplinary discussion so we borrow from
one another, people in different disciplines often have different perspectives on a
problem, which is very valuable. So Cheryl, I see that your hand is up. Why don't
we go to you? - I have a very, very interesting case.
- Okay, so you'd like to discuss it. Oh, you, okay. Well, awesome. Is this likely
to be, you wanna go into it or did you want to get in the line? I can get in
the line, no problem. I just was wondering if you were wanting to talk about it
right now.
Whenever is good. Okay. All right, let's do this. Let's get Laura's taken care of.
I'm trying to take them in order. So we'll go with Laura and Cheryl. Then we will
rush eagerly back to you to hear what's going on. Don't rush.
- Okay, Laura Levin, we'll turn it over to you. - Okay, and I also have - - When
you're giving background, I'll pull up the data that you sent me. So, Jeff, do you
have permission to share my, I'm sorry, Laura, to share my screen? - Yeah. - Okay,
now Laura, the floor is yours. - I also have a question from a client, but it
shouldn't take too long to cover. So, we'll start with the thing I shared. So this
client is very discerning. We do 1 % 100 offset,
16 to 20 seconds now that we've been doing it for a while and usually four pairs
of sites. And we were following a site sort last week on Thursday.
And when I did three and T four, I noticed that just watching it run,
that, let's see, T three was really high amplitude, and they were not,
those two sites were not balanced at all. So I just-- - Are you seeing the data?
Are you seeing the data on the screen now? - Yes, yep, yep.
- So, so I told her what I was seeing and I said, hey, I'd just like to run it
on those sites again if you're okay with that and she was totally fine with that.
So the second time I clicked C3 and C4 instead of T3 and T4 so we could tell
which one was the first run and second run. And yeah,
I'm trying to, okay is this, this doesn't look like,
oh wait, it was in frequency that it was really high, not amplitude, sorry. But you
can see T3 is really high and the bar is like halfway down and T4 is very low,
it's down to 2 .5 in frequency. And so we ran it again as C3 and C4.
And you can see that C3, which would be T3 came way down and then C4 went up a
little. And so I just showed her the results just for kicks. And she said she had
just gotten over an ear infection on her right ear, which would be by T4. And that
that ear has given her problems her whole life, even as a kid, she'd get your
infections in that ear and not the other. So I just thought it was really
interesting. And my theory was that the high frequency on T3 might be trying to
compensate for the stuff going on in T4 with ear infection and just being healed
from that. And then I just wanted to get any thoughts on that anybody that has any
theories.
Looking for hands that are raised.
Anybody have any ideas for Laura?
Christy? Christy.
It was a scene. It looked like it was Christy, but it might have been Courtney.
Well, Cheryl, could you unmute your mic for just a little bit? There's a place on
the screen where it will, it puts people's names if they're speaking,
So it would pick up if your mic is open. Actually, there's nobody that has their
hand up. So I'm guessing that I'll just tell you what I think about this. I'm
going to put it back on the measurement so we can look at it.
So here's the T3 that was so high the first run. And it's interesting.
I mean, definitely you could get
a homologous sort of thing going on there with T4 to balance it out.
Another possibility is that because it's a temporal lobe site, it's really easy for
muscle artifact to creep up into that reading. And the reading is real.
It's just that it's generated by muscle rather than brain. So that's So that's
another possibility. And often, the lens can have such a nice relaxing effect on the
muscles. So it's certainly plausible. It's also plausible that there was some
relationship with the homologous side. So those are the two things that come to mind
for me. Let me check in with Daphne and see if she has anything else that is
occurring to her? You know what I really don't Lisa I do remember something I just
said no and I'm gonna share something so sorry about that years ago and I believe
it might have been spike that had shared that that sometimes there may be a
correlation between what we see in the frequency at T3 T4 kind of those areas and
heavy metals But we don't have enough information on that to kind of move forward
with it But it was something that There may there may be a correlation there as
well Although this is only on one side and that both of it changed right away So
I wouldn't expect that that would be something that's contributing to this But it is
something when you see kind of the ear muffs in the frequency around the ears It's
all I got so okay. Well, I'm gonna just scroll down And remember, I know what
you're saying about the earmuffs. And also, we're going to have that earmuff look
because it's not a full site sort. It's a limited number of sites.
OK, so scrolling on down, looking at T3 is the site that had the really high
frequency activity. We're just going to see if we can see where that's coming from.
So scrolling on down,
Here's T3 here, so it's kind of in the middle on that one. These amplitudes of
frequency are not particularly, they're not high. Interesting.
Here's T3 here. So more in beta and then in high beta.
Okay.
Now, Laura, do you know how these coded as far as the suppression maps was it?
I didn't really look at that.
One thing I'm thinking though is like typically we've done these sites before with
her and typically there's not that really high frequency at T3.
She's also very, very self -aware. She's about 30 years old,
very self -aware, very, she has ADHD, neurodivergent, queer,
not the, I mean, it just kind of, kind of gives more of a picture.
But she, and she meditates things like that. So, And I don't know, I think I have
some clients maybe that when they close their eyes and are just sitting there, they,
they really regulate automatically because it's like they're go to and I don't know
if they're close. Yeah, and I don't know if that can lower the frequencies or not.
I think you have a lot of clients with low frequencies. Yeah. Yeah, especially if
you close your eyes, the frequencies in the front of the brain reliably will go
down. And if they don't, that actually can cause problems.
Okay.
Okay. Well, thank you. I really like the way you were paying attention to what the
information that you were getting. And just having that attitude of curiosity.
Yeah, I think that honestly, the level two training like, was so amazing because it
made me not afraid to play around with clients, you know, and just see. Yeah,
it's just, I'm not afraid, I'm not gonna hurt anybody, and I always talk to them
if I wanna do something different, like, can we try this? We don't have to,
whatever, but yeah, and it's made me even more, and I'm really excited when you do
your maps training because it's made me more like I'm the screen and and
understanding a lot more what I'm seeing while the program's running which is really
cool so. Well and you know it takes a while to get to the point where you can
take that in as well I mean I think that speaks to your maturation as a lens
clinician because it's all of this is such a paradigm shift from what most of us
were doing before we got a lens I mean it's it's a different way of working and
it's different types of information to pay attention to so um anyway this was cool
and uh and it'll be great to hear how it plays out for her so um maybe next week
if you if she's been back in maybe you could just let us know what her experience
okay yeah I'll do that and then um just real quick so I have a a client.
She's 60 some. She's on disability. She had strokes in her eyes like a couple years
ago and just lots of problems. And she comes in yesterday and she did not want to
do therapy. She wanted to do lens and then she wanted to talk about it. And she
wants to understand and she goes, I don't care if you go with it because I said,
well, I could ask in the webinar. She goes, I don't care if you go in there and
say, ""This woman is driving me crazy with her questions."" She's like, ""I love this
one."" - Yeah, it's fine. - Yeah, so anyways, she wants to understand in layman's
terms, what is the communication that's going on when the lens is running?
She's like, ""Is it activating neurons? Is it stimulating neurons? Is it creating new
neural pathways? What is it doing?"" So I said, ""I would ask."" So it's an
interesting way of thinking about what drives what. So in terms of creating neural
pathways, the lens doesn't do that, the body does that. The organism does that.
In terms of letting go of old patterns of activation, the body does that.
What the lens does is provide an opening to get out of the habit, the physiological
habit that correlates with the problems. So some people will talk about that as a
reset, or, you know, but the way the body resets is unique to that individual.
- So when the, okay, when the feedback is actually going back, is it,
so the program's running, it's it in information and it sends that you know one
percent or a hundred percent of feedback. Is that feedback a reflection of the
dominant frequency and the dominant amplitude that the brain is putting out? Yes in
the same way that your shadow is a reflection of you
general contours. Okay. What is, what does offset refer to?
Offset refers to the numerical constant that's added to the dominant frequency.
Okay. It's strictly a mathematical process that we're having the computer do.
Okay. You better remember the lens is working with
in the domain of whatever it is, it's subtle. - Yeah.
- Plus, you know, which this is not, this is not an electrical generator or a
frequency generator in the traditional sense. - Yeah. And she's done a transmagnetic
stimulation, which was helped a little bit, but not much.
So, okay. Yeah. And I keep to, and I'm very honest. I tell her what I don't know.
And I can't, yeah. So I feel like this is a good explaining the offset and yeah,
that it's a, yeah. I'm grasping a little more what it is.
And she'll just have to be happy with what I have because-- - Well, and I encourage
you, listen, as I don't care as many times as she needs to ask the question a
different way or to come back, it's okay because guess what? Other people are having
these questions all all the time. Even like sometimes I ask myself like,
I've been doing the lens over 20 years almost, which is really something to think
about. Not quite 20 years, but almost that's a long time.
And still, in terms of the actual mechanism, Lynn used to say it's information.
But I still grappled with the question of well what is the domain of the
information and how is the information conveyed? Yeah and that's I think she wants
to understand that how is the information conveyed that's yeah. So you know if you
go by sort of the story of the electromagnetic emissions from the equipment coupling
with your the energy of the person somehow coupling with the person, it would be in
that domain. It's like there's a relationship between what the computer and the amp
are giving off and the individual because it's measuring that individual. If it were
measuring somebody else, it wouldn't relate to that individual anymore. It'd relate to
the other individual. So it's always
About what the what the software and the amplifier are doing based on the physiology
of the person But it's coupled With a physiological process that affects the person
now. It's got to be in a subtle domain It's not really even measurable right it's
I mean if you if you get You might be able to pick up a little something with
the narrowband, but with standard lens, you can't even measure anything.
So it's not about a quantity of charge or something like that,
but they're in the domain of light And in the domain of electrons, there are ways
that signals cancel each other out if they are aligned and they're opposite.
If you think back to chemistry, if you've got a negative and a positive and you
put them together, it's like you lose the charge. It becomes hidden by the presence
of that other energetic state. So, we could be shifting something as subtle as the
balance of ionic charge, which is governed by electrons, or it could be in the
domain of light, which personally I think is more and more plausible. Because
sometimes when I look at my electrodes, it's like they've got a little glow around
the end of them. You know, so, could be something in the domain of light,
which doesn't have mass. It doesn't have-- it's not a forceful kind of thing.
It's just shifting something there, and the body knows it. So you don't probably
want to discuss all that with your client, because that was a confusing explanation.
But I mean, we still don't have a great mechanistic explanation for how the lens is
working. If it is working in the domain of light, probably all of the amplifiers
are working in the domain of light and then something else. You know, so just
because
just because the frequency, fixed frequency kind of approaches are rewarding a
specific agenda doesn't mean the other things aren't also happening. I mean,
the lens is probably the most fundamental of all the neurofeedback systems because
it's really about the relationship between the client and the equipment.
Which is, you know, that's occurring in any of the other neurofeedback approaches.
You cannot get away from that fundamental relationship of the client and the
equipment.
So the lens I think is foundational and that's why I always say I always start
with lens because I think it's the most foundational and the most general.
So thank you for that. I feel like even when you said you might not want to say
all this to her I think this is what you're talking about is The information she
wants so I jotted some of it down and I did tell her I said I think that
hopefully Understanding more of what's actually happening will be the next step in
all this technology as we move forward You know, but we don't and I even brought
up. I was like penicillin worked, but they didn't know why You know
They still don't have a concrete, You know, right? There's a lot of thoughts about
how these things work, but in terms of actually teasing it out in terms of the
scientific method, we're just not there yet. Yeah. But you can see like when I talk
about the possibility that it might be affecting things in the light domain, I have
actually seen lectures by physiologists who talk about
mitochondrial function and the generation of cellular energy related to mitochondrial
function as what is behind generating the charge changes that result in changes in
the EEG. Well that makes sense. You've got to have energy to move those brainwaves.
But then if that's the case, if it's because the mitochondria give off these little
packets of light. So you know, whether we think of it as a positive charge or a
little packet of light, maybe where we're working is in that network of effect that
results from the lighting emissions from the body. I mean, there's a device that's
in India, It's called a biofield viewer, which they used to look at,
well, the biofield on people. But the guy's name is Thornton Streeter.
And he's been working with this for a long time, and apparently now has a way of
imaging two people at the same time.
And that's really interesting to me because I think that maybe there's something with
the lens where we are not only exchanging information about the person,
but there may be that there's some level at which we're exchanging information
between the clinician and the client or whoever's sitting in the chair. I mean,
we call them the client, but the recipient of the lens or the primary on the lens.
It would be exciting to explore that. We just don't I don't have I don't have
access to a biofield viewer. There may be other devices around. I know that when
Nick Dogress was first making the neuro field he bought a gas discharge visualizer
but then he didn't hang on to that it didn't wouldn't quite do what he wanted and
I think that would probably not do what we would need. But the biofield viewer
maybe.
Anyway there there are people out there in the world doing interesting things all
the time and if we can figure out who they are and write on their coattails a
little bit and try to you know get inside the concepts they're working with.
Let me go back here, on my screen,
I'm seeing a lens map. I'm guessing that you guys are not.
>> I'm going to go ahead, and this is Daphne, I'm going to go ahead and send a
representation to you. >> I have multiple windows open. I'm going to close, Laura,
I'm going to close your map data now. I want to thank you for sending that.
And thank you so much for all this today.
All right. Window.
OK.
So I want to ask you not to say anything, But, well,
let me stay here, hold on.
This is the map I want you to look at. Don't say anything, just write it down. Do
you notice anything?
- Lisa, this is Daphne. We're seeing your go -to training screen. - Oh, you're not
seeing it yet. All right, let's see.
We're see my go -to training
And now, still go to training?
Or is it a map?
Um, just he'll go to training.
Okay.
Could you minimize the go -to training screen and then we'll see what's behind it?
How about that? I? Minimized it. Are you seeing him out now? I'm just seeing a
white screen right now
Oh,
you know, so close and yet so far.
Never seen you go to a training screen again. Yeah, I'm going to stop sharing for
a minute. I'm going to ask you to resend that. OK. So I'll need to take it away
and then resend. So can we just-- Take it away, and then generously give it back.
OK.
It's giving me options of which window to share. I think this might do it.
Everybody hold your breath.
OK. Are you now looking at a standard map? We are. Oh, hallelujah.
All right. So I don't want anybody to say anything. I want you to just take a
look at this map and write down what you think is interesting about the map, what
you notice about it. And I'll give a minute to look at the amplitude and then I'll
scroll down so you can more fully see the other frequency domain.
All right, so just take a look at it and
I'll tell you a little bit about this client. This is my 51 -year -old woman who
has progressive memory loss and it's short -term memory and some autobiographical
memory. So she's already been worked out. She's worked up. She's followed by a
neurologist. She's had brain scans. They found some kind of aberrant stuff in the
left parietal area but nothing that should be producing these symptoms. They don't
really know what to make of it. She does have a history of trauma earlier in life.
She does have a history of concussion. She said when she was about five years old,
well no seven, she was she was homeschooled. They were her mother was deeply
religious and didn't send the kids to school. And so they were at the park and she
was in the swing and she scraped her somehow hit her face on the concrete.
They just had concrete under the swings. Somehow she hit her face and skinned it up
really badly and she was kind of messed up after that. They didn't take her for
medical treatment or anything, but she remembers that being an awful time.
Then later in life after she got out from her mom's home,
she was in an abusive relationship. Her boyfriend gave her a pretty good concussion.
She said once and then she left. Interestingly, although she didn't have any
schooling in her childhood, she was able to go to like credit recovery kind of
stuff and she was able to go to school as an adult. So she eventually got her
high school credential and all that. So she had enough memory to get through high
school equivalency. So that was good to know.
Anyway, so there's a trauma history, there's a head injury piece and then there's
this physiological abnormality in the back of her head that they don't know what to
make of and it's not clear from the medical records that I've been able to see
whether the diagnosis is actually functional neurological disorder or whether it's what
they call neurological amnesia. She thinks it's neurological amnesia But there's some
things in the paperwork that make me think it might be also functional neurological
disorder Which doesn't really make a whole lot of sense because functional usually
implies that there's not a Structural thing that you can point to there are some
structural abnormalities. Anyway, nobody really knows what this is But she's been
worsening for 13 years She's off carbohydrates, she's dropped 35 pounds.
I've seen her three times and the first time she came in she is neither sensitive
nor reactive. She was very foggy, not able to tell me very much,
and she said, you know, I'm not gonna remember.
I'll know that I was here but I probably won't remember our conversation and sure
enough the next time she came I asked her if she remembered my name and she did
not. She said I decided it was Kathy. She didn't try to think of it all the way
to the appointment. So she is able to use a phone for reminders and schedule
keeping and all that so she hasn't missed any appointments. The third time I saw
her she looked brighter to me. Her memory didn't appear to be any better but she
did seem a little bit better. Anyway just look at this map and see what you notice
about it.
Okay. - So Lisa, one of the things that I notice is that I don't see a C3 and
C4. - Yes, Betty, you are so right. So when I do a math,
the first thing I always do is count the sides, right? But this time, I was so
captivated by the complexity of this situation.
I first did, because I did it in one session, I used a 100 % four -second offset
of 100, which is a very light mapping application. And yeah,
I looked at it and I was like, ""Holy smokes, this must be the problem !"" But it
wasn't. I took a closer look and I realized I'd missed the sites. So here's the
correct map. Let me go back here. All right,
here's the map with those. I just put her back in the chair and said, ""Oh, I
missed two and I fixed them."" So you can see it looks quite a bit different when
you have that missing data in there, right? I mean, it's still an unusual formation.
That line thing is something worth paying attention to as we go forward to see if
it stays like that or whether it changes. But it is a different impression when you
don't have those missing holes there.
The other thing that I notice is that all of the really low amplitudes are in the
front. Yes. Yeah. She is taking an antidepressant.
She doesn't know which one, and it's not in... She brought me some of her medical
records, but not everything. So she is on an antidepressant. She said, ""I don't
know. I don't feel depressed, but I can see why they would have her on an
antidepressant because depression is so affected by that frontal a lobe function,
but like Betty was saying in the front we've got FP2, FP1, T4, F4, F3, T3,
everything forward of the ears, you know, just low and not much standard deviation
at all.
So we'll just scroll down so you can see the other frequency bands.
It doesn't really show very much in-- like in delta and theta,
it's pretty unremarkable. I think that's largely because of the scale of the display.
So that just is what it is. That might change as we go along.
In alpha, you can see it looks a little bit, you know, more like what we were
seeing in the the tools.
So let's take a look at the suppression map.
I thought this was interesting, right through the middle. And this is with all the
data accounted for here. So here's C3 and C4 right here.
I won't say I've never seen that. I have seen it before where there's a strip
through the area between the ears of the sensory motor area, but I don't see that
very often, that formation.
I think this is interesting, you know. This is you know on the on the standard map
what we were seeing is from the basically from the ears forward the sensory motor
strip forward lots of low frequency and from this map we can see not only you know
that that frequency that's there in some of it's kind of wild t3 fp1 Well,
these are in the good zone, but the back is so much more locked down in terms of
the standard
deviation, the pattern.
So, okay, here this is the mean delta amplitude looking at the coefficient of
variation. But this is interesting because that blue area, that would be touching
over close to where that they said she had that physical anomaly. So I don't know
whether that will change or whether it will stay. It's just interesting.
So that's the pretty pictures. - So what do you think would happen if you used
single channel
and, 'cause you had done homologous here, right? With two channels? - I did for the
first map, 'cause she's got a history of, she said they weren't sure whether it was
seizures or whether it was narcolepsy. And to me,
that's a big difference between those conditions, you know. And she said,
but nothing was really going on now. And she said, and it's down to four from 18
an hour. To me, that sounded more like a sleep study kind of information.
But either way, she's got something that would be like a core, right? Kind of inner
history okay meeting her she doesn't look like she there's nothing about her that
seems reactive in any way but um because that was in her history I did and I and
honestly because she could tell me so little I want I wanted to get off a whole
head of the map as soon as I could and she didn't appear to be affected by the
what I was doing so I just kept going um But you're right, a single channel might
give us a result that would be more useful. This is starting point. Yeah.
So when she came back, even the very first time I, so every time I was seeing her
I have also used the tonic on her. I don't know that we're going to know what's
at the origin of this decline that she's had, but more and more evidence supports
for metabolic insufficiency for the maintenance and progression of memory loss.
So, I mean, I think it's possible that she's got multiple problems and they're just
making each other worse.
But it doesn't really get more foundational than the metabolism. So I
think the first time, and now I'm not sure because I didn't write this down about
the photonic,
often we'll go to the the left above the left eye because that's often a good way
to shift the mood and it'll give you some you get some indication of response in
this to the light she didn't appear to shift at all with that I usually do for
four minutes at a time I set my my phone on a timer and I'll do it for four
minutes then after that I did the sites associated with the default mode network And
that's what I've been doing when she comes in. So that's, you know, I do four
sites. I do FZ, PZ,
P3 and P4, and I do each of them for four minutes with the photonic stimulator.
So I don't know, this third time that I've seen her though, she did, she looked a
little perkier. So - She says that's-- - Had not seen her for two weeks.
- That's in addition to just over the left eye?
- Yes. - So you're doing five sites there. - Well, this last time that she came, I
just did the four. - Okay.
- But anyway, I think I'm gonna need to put her on something to use between visits.
And
I'm just trying to decide, I've got some, I mean, I have some things at my office
that I can share with people in between. In her case, my concern was whether or
not she could remember to do it. And she said, Oh, I'll just put it in my phone.
I mean, her, her attitude is very cooperative and,
you know, she's, I guess my Part of my concern is I don't know her very well,
and I don't want my expensive equipment to go missing like she's got memory
problems, and you know, I don't want her to misplace my stuff, but
That's kind of a different level of concern. She she seems very Eager to help
herself, and I think she probably would do whatever Whatever she could if she could
remember to do it. So anyway, I wanted to show you her map because of that thing
with the missing data to see if you pick it up. So good job, Betty, and the rest
of you who spotted it. It's still an interesting map,
and it's still an interesting problem set.
And every time I see her, she says, ""Have you worked with anybody with my problem
before?"" And every time I say, Not exactly, but I have worked with people who've
had had trauma and been able to help them or concussion history. Been able to be
helpful to people with trauma history. And so head injury trauma history and then if
there's some kind of progressive neurological condition. I have had situations where
it could be helpful with that. So I think, you know, the only way to know is to
try, you know, and they don't give up easily, but she's got a,
she's got a lot of, a lot of symptomatology to move.
So anyway, that's what I wanted to show you about that. Any questions? - Yeah,
Lisa, I want to know how did you get,
How did you how could you? Get the map that showed no C3 and no C4.
Oh Okay, if you look here and then show the other map that had the C3 and C4 and
yes Here's the man this line here is the map has almost all the size.
You see it has 19 sites in it instead of 21. So that's the one that was missing.
That's the one that's here. Okay. When you say,
are you using your great big arrow, which I like a lot? I am using the great big
arrow. So the bottom line of the green is the one was the first 19 sites. And I
thought I had everything done, so I exited. Then I realized I was missing the data
and I captured that in this line above. So if I want to display it without the
complete 21 sites, then I just click this,
that bottom line of data and that is what you see here. Lisa,
I don't think we're seeing what you're seeing. Are you clicking on the same word
and then the pop -up screen comes up? We're not seeing the pop -up screen.
the pop -up screen of the lens so you're you're pointing to these little squares
over here on the left hand side of the
is that right Lisa yeah on the left hand side of my screen these two data bytes
missing but on again maybe we're not able to see when you know when you click on
on your lens top line and you click on the for the maps or the yeah and reports
is report yeah and then you get a little pop up screen that's what I was wanting
to maybe it's not coming through on no I I hear what you're saying you were able
to take a picture of it But then go back and do this see with with both lines of
data. Yes. That was a complete compliment Okay But then how and then how did you
keep that?
Okay, well over here if you look at do you see my big arrow?
I do Okay, so they're these little tabs at the top. That's one map.
Here's another. And here's another. Got it. Right.
So. Okay, what I was going to say is if you
Oh, I see what you did. Okay, I got it. Thank you. Yes.
Thanks for paying attention. Yeah.
Before I leave the map screens, does anybody else have a question about the maps?
You'll just have to speak up because I can't really see the hand raising. I have
to tell you thanks for the big arrow. Oh, you're welcome.
All right. I'm going to close out of my minimize my lens. Now I should be back on
the screen with your happy faces. Let's see. Active campus. There we go.
Okay.
That's everybody.
We haven't talked about the holidays that are coming up, but this year, Christmas
Eve and New Year's Eve, both fall on a Tuesday. And so
I'm going to suggest that we just suspend for those weeks.
Most people are out of the office or have minimal client activity. If you get stuck
on anything, you can, of course, right to the lens list, or if it feels really
pressing, you feel free to write to me. I mean, I'll be checking my email, but I'm
going to be down in Atlanta with my sister and her family and just anyway just
because it's Chris Steven and New Year's Eve if you don't mind we'll just take a
break.
Thumbs going up, great.
Alright, somebody sent me a message. Let me see here.
What's in the chat?
Oh, how about signing her up for the listening program? It would activate her brain.
Chrissy, that's a great idea. And actually, I have a couple of stats of the
listening program that are older, that I have on CDs, but I could totally give a
try with that and see what that would do for It's not going to hurt her, it's
pleasant. If she can put it in her phone and remember to do it,
I think that's a fabulous idea. Because also, I'm just looking for anything to help
prop her up in between her visits to my office. And she already is balking at
coming once a week.
So I generally try to take the attitude that
it's my job to figure out how to work with a person, but sometimes it seems like
the problems are really big to only see them once in a blue moon. But I've had
some people who live very far away where it just did not work out for them to
come at the regular frequency, and they still saw improvement. So,
So, after I lived through that a few times, I decided to try to present it to the
person as maybe desirable to come more frequently, but if they can't, they can't,
and we'll do the best we can. So, you know, the listening program is a great idea,
yes, David suggests the infrared wrist band. I have thought about that. I have a V
-Lite that's the original the original ones not the headset just the little it's just
like a little battery pack with a nasal applicator that has an 810 frequency for
intranasal elimination. Now people can buy their own their own nasal applicator or
you can sterilize the one you've got. My people generally prefer to sterilize it and
you can do that by rubbing, taking alcohol and rubbing it over the cord in the
end, and then we put plastic over it. So you just get a little piece of saran
wrap and put it over that. Let me see, I'll show you.
And Daphne, thank you for your indulgence because this is not an Oaks Lab's product,
but it's useful to know what you can do for people in these extreme situations to
support them between their visits. Whatever gets her well, it's not going to be just
one thing. She's got more than one thing going on. Here's a little applicator. On
this one, I do have those blue sleeves that go over the edge, but it was bothering
my nose. So I just put a little piece of a little sponge thing that it was
actually the liner in the case of my red light,
Ken, that I got from Walgreens. They used to sell them in the office supplies. It
had a red LED on the end. And that's the one that I used,
the laser pointer that I used to use on people's fingertips. They don't sell them
anymore. Anyway, you can take a piece of saran wrap and just pull the square down
over this little, it looks like a bullet here. It's kind of bullet shape that goes
in the nose. And if you take the ends of the saran wrap and just twist and twist
and twist and twist, it'll make a long thin tail of twisted plastic and you can
take a breath wrapper and just anchor it to the wire. And then they can clean that
plastic or they can change that plastic every time if they want, but that's what we
that's what we do for sanitation with the reuse of these little devices. Most of my
people don't want to buy anything until they know it's working for them. So anyway,
yes, those are all great ideas. And Lisa, what does that do?
It's similar to the red light, red light,
wrist light that I have where you're illuminating the blood. It's a blood
illumination strategy, but it's up closer to the brain. And it's a wavelength that's
associated more than neurological problems. - Uh -huh, okay. - It's closer to the
wavelength of the photonic, right? The red light, the wrist light is around 650,
which is helpful for lots of things. The longer wavelengths have slightly different
effects.
- And these are-- - And we'll use these expressions. And where do you get that? What
is it?
This little device here is essentially a light bulb with a battery pack,
and it's made by a company called V -Lite, V -I -E -L -I -D -H -T.
Lisa, we're seeing a map on screen, and And the device you're holding up is it is
everybody else not seeing the device either
Correct
Thanks for that David. All right. I'm just gonna get rid of that hole
I'm gonna close out now now you're looking at the screen. Okay. Here's the little
back. It just has it has a double a batteries this is the nose thing here.
I'm sorry y 'all weren't seeing that before.
Okay, got it. So it clips on. I'll just put it in my nose so you can see. That's
it. And it runs on about a 30 minute cycle. So you can tell it's running because
it's got a little light on the indicator light. And - You look like Rudolph.
- And I look like Rudolph, yes. But anyway, when I was explaining, I hope you guys
are understanding now what I meant about the saran wrap, right? Or the plastic wrap
is so that people can understand whether they can tolerate it. I've had one person
who actually gave me theirs because she couldn't stand in her nose. I don't find it
to be a problem, But people have different shaped noses. Like my colleague,
Melissa, she finds it uncomfortable. Well, she's Filipino. Her facial features are a
little bit different than mine. So it's nice for people to be able to understand
whether it's comfortable. They have a very good return policy. And I don't have any
financial relationship with that company. I want to be clearer. - It's very, thank
you for telling. It's very seasonal.
Seasonal. Yes, exactly right. Yeah. So,
you know, Y 'all have heard me talking about my brother. That was one of the things
that he would do. I got the wavelength that would be supported for cardiovascular
health and he did it every day. I have a picture of him with his electric guitar
and his V -light in his nose and his martial arts dummy right next to him so you
know it's tolerable for a lot of people when some of the other things are not even
the headset which is those can be great products but they're not for everybody you
know you just got to figure out what people can do and what they can tolerate so
anyway
so Lisa
- Oh, Cheryl, go ahead.
- I don't, oh, we're kind of out of time. I don't know how to send this to you.
I have it up on my computer right here. How do I get you my map?
- Okay, let's just do that quickly.
- Have you downloaded the map as a PDF? - Yes. - Have you taken your name off of
it? - It doesn't matter.
- Okay, if you're saying it doesn't matter, it's okay with me. So you just go into
your email?
- I don't even have that set up on here. - Okay, you're gonna have to somehow get
the data off of that computer to a computer where you can send an email to me.
Can I show you?
Honestly, it's because it's a black and white map. It's not very effective. How
about if I show you the screen like
>>
I have to lower whatever you're viewing.
>>
You know what, Cheryl, let's do this.
Let's walk through saving it as a PDF now. And then, can you -- do you have
another computer that is on the internet? >> This one, the one I'm talking to.
You do have email from the computer where you are now? Yeah.
Okay, where did your PDF maps say? Are they in the downloads folder?
Uh,
is there one? Wait one second. No. No,
let's I thought I saved it. Uh, no
No, I guess it's not here.
Uh, no
Well, all right, I've got one thing. We've got just a couple of minutes I'm gonna
tell you what what I would do in this case because it's it's not clicking with as
far as sending it by email. You can get your phone, you can take a picture of the
screen, and you can send the photo to me, and then I'll have it for next week.
Okay, so just to let you know a little history here,
I've had this lens now for one year, and it has not,
my map has not moved. And I've been doing this religiously.
I've had nine concussions and severe emotional trauma and abuse young.
I have one 10 on sensitivity. I get lots of exercise,
I sleep well, I eat pretty well.
I have noticed a lot of improvement in my memory since I've purchased the lens for
a year, but my map is totally stuck.
And most of the sites don't even I'm not even like if I go down to where is it
oh
I'll just yeah like they're they're like it one hurts just stuck in what does she
call it survival mode.
I have no anxiety. So we have tried thus far with a first map of 1 % at 4
seconds. We've gone up to doubling where I've been on the machine for up to a half
an hour where we've done two, four, eight. I went to Mike's and he did a bunch of
stuff. He gave me an application of two eight two. Then we did an application of
one percent for one second. We have tried everything for a year and the map doesn't
move. So I would love to see your first map and your last map and they're exactly
the same but I would really like it if you would send it to me what I'll say is
suppression is not the enemy you've had would you say nine or eleven concussions how
many was it nine oh nine concussions that's a lot of concussions Cheryl you know
plus emotional trauma I I think sometimes with the suppression of the brainwave
signals right these are the these are signals that we're talking about we're looking
at the variability of the signals.
Sometimes the variability doesn't change a whole lot but that whatever is tied up in
the suppression is slowly at its own pace it's releasing itself.
Yeah But it's not. Well, it's not showing in the maps, but you've had symptomatic
improvement.
And I would not discount the symptomatic. That is what we're going for. Sometimes
the suppression and the lens maps, it's like making up the bed with the covers on.
It's got to keep things steady enough for you to function. I would love to see
your maps. I'd love to see your first map and your last map or maybe one in the
middle, whatever you can share in that regard. But if you're getting symptomatic
improvement and you cited memory is a really foundational thing to be better.
That's a big win when your memory gets better. So it
may just be where where your body mind is in the change process.
But I would be, I'd be happy to look at those maps. And if you can't send them
to me as regular PDFs, then take a photo with your, with your camera, but try to
do a good job and get the whole thing.
And we'll talk about slow change next week. Okay, it's,
I don't even have your email. Okay, it's Psychologics, P -S -Y -C -H -O -L -O -G -I -C -S
at yahoo .com, and
if you ever can't find it, just look on the lens list and there'll be an old
poster so then you can always get it there.
Okay. Another thing that would be fun for you to do at some point is do you have
access to a TOVA or a continuing like a quick test or do you have access to
anybody have access to that you're nearby? Take a quick test and then in another
six, eight months take another quick test. Do you know what I'm talking about? No.
A toba. Yeah. Well, next time we meet I'll bring it up or Lisa knows what it is.
She can tell you. I'm glad that you're bringing that up and we'd love to. I think
it's nice for people to hear from clinicians other than myself. So if you'd like to
bring people up to speed a little bit on those next time, that'd be great.
Thank you everyone for your attendance today, for your support for one another, for
your I hope you have a great week. We'll see you next week. - Thanks, everyone.
- Thank you, Lisa. Thanks, everybody. - Thank you. - Bye -bye. - Thank you."

More from Your Lens."" I'm your facilitator, Dr. Lisa Merrifield, and this is our
hour to take questions about the use of the lens, things that you're seeing with
your clients, questions about who might be helped, and how to get a better result.
So we take a broad view of what's useful here. It's an open discussion across
disciplines so feel free to chime in and say whatever's on your mind.
I've had two people contact me today about things that they wanted to cover on the
call and one is Renee McGuire who's here and so Renee I'm gonna I'm gonna see our
are you ready to to discuss your situation or can you how's how is talking for
you? Yes I can talk. Okay great. Well I got your email which was helpful and for
the benefit of the rest of the group could you go ahead and tell us what's going
on?
Last week I developed Bell's palsy and which for those that don't know is a
paralysis of typically the right side of the face and went to the ER because my
husband thought I was having a stroke. So but it's it's just Bell's palsy which is
more annoying than anything. It's hard to eat, difficult to speak,
hard to drink, and your eye tends to water a lot and so For them,
all they could do was give me prednisone and acyclovir and some eye drops and said
10 days to six months. So I'm looking for something to reduce the time.
Sure. So did they screen you for any infectious agents?
I did not have any virus. I've been under a bit of stress from my mother going in
the hospital unexpectedly and and then getting injured in the hospital rather badly.
So, they think it's probably that.
Okay, you know, I'm not. I'm not familiar with Bell's palsy being caused by stress.
But I would say that stress seems to make everything worse. And so, I mean, it's,
I guess, not out of the realm of possibility. They have the medical end of things.
I'm glad you don't have a virus. Lyme disease is what came to mind because that is
something that you often will see in Lyme. So just tuck that in the back of your
mind, in your memory, in case there's any, if it doesn't clear in a timely manner.
I have been tested for Lyme in the past not recently and I did not have it but
I'll certainly will keep that in mind thank you.
Yeah I can see why your husband was concerned about stroke and I'm glad you went
right away and got yourself checked out. So can you tell us people on the call
don't know you as a person, can you tell us about your history with the lens,
your sensitivity, reactivity, hardiness, that kind of thing?
I work for Sharon Sudall with Three Valley Wellness. She is trauma therapist here,
and I am strictly her lens technician, so I don't have any therapy background at
all. I just do the lens for my sensitivity.
Tends to be medium, low reactivity,
good resiliency. So if somebody was going to do some lens for you,
what would be a typical protocol that would be useful for you to get you out of
your, you know, getting a shift.
Well, Sharon and I like to try different things all the time.
So, so far I'm doing pretty well with just about everything. There's been one time
when it was just a little bit too much, but that was my own fault. Can you give
us an idea about what that was And just to give people a context for what when
you say, you know, I did something and it was a little maybe a little too much.
What are we talking about? I think it was one of the variable 17 seconds and we
probably ran at eight times eight different sites. But I mean,
I've done body lens 88 seconds and then another 20 on top of that and I'm fine
with that. So usually do that. Did you get any positive result from that?
Oh, I did. I just was irritable for a couple of days after the variable 17 second
one. But I usually do get positive results from any lens we do.
Interesting. that's one of the most interesting things about lens to me really is
you'll often hear me say there are so many ways to get it right but that's a
you're a great example right no matter what you do it usually helps you some so
right right yeah um so can you tell the group what you have tried for the Bell's
palsy up to now well I tried uh my My husband came over here to the office with
me the day I got out of the emergency room and Megan was helping me try to figure
it out. I'm not sure we did it exactly right, but as I said in my email,
we did that motorstrip.
We did nine rounds of body lens long, C3, C4,
C3, C4, and CZ using regular head sensors and then we had body sensors in the two
reference in the ground and I didn't know where to put them exactly on my face.
I just put them on that side and that's how we ran it.
We at the time we didn't have the PS available but we have gotten it back today.
So I am anxious to use that as well. We had to wait for that cord that Megan
sent to see if it would work with the pen. So that's what I've tried.
I have been laying on the bio mat today. So we had gotten a bio mat here. So
I've done that for about 15, 20 minutes today. Okay,
that seems like a good thing to do, supportive. With the lens that you did,
the body lens that you did, can you say a little bit about the degree of effect
that you saw? Did you see no, absolutely no effect from what you did? Maybe a tiny
bit, not a lot,
just a small amount.
Can you describe what what the change was, the small amount of change? Was it in
pain or like the the degree of droop in the face or the eye? It's more the degree
of droop in the mouth. Okay. The eye isn't as droopy but of course it's not
blinking unless physically make it close but the degree of the droop I'm not having
really a lot of pain I'm having a little bit back in the back of my jaw like
when you get a sinus infection occasionally so but that's about it it just looks
like my mouth's kind of melted.
Daphne,
you look thoughtful. You look like you might have something to share with Renee. No,
I'm just sitting, just kind of remembering the case that we worked out in class.
I don't know, Lisa, if you saw that image, but the lady had presented with what
appeared to be Belle's palsy on one side of the face, but it was quite a while
afterwards. It wasn't immediate.
Yeah, with regard to Renee, Renee started right away. This was quite a long time
between when she came in to be trained in the lens. And then we use that with
her. So I'm kind of curious about the timeline on this. We also have used just
lens with that case, for example, and then just the PS with another case that
somebody approached me with that. And both of those were quite effective with it. So
don't give up on it yet, but I don't know that I have anything yet to share. I'm
just kind of listening to the information right >> When you were using the photonic
stimulator by itself, Daphne, were you treating directly on the area that was
affected or were you treating over the motor cortex or what was your-- >> No,
I'm not quite sure about the motor cortex, but we were just working with the nerve
itself. >> Okay. >> Where, you know, where it was innervating. So, and I,
you know, I don't know, I mean, it's always a really good question of where you
can ruin a little placement and what works and what doesn't. That's just what we
did that time. - Do you remember anything about the exposure time?
- Oh, I don't because I sent the person home with it and it was one of those
indications where I said, it appears as though this might be a good amount for you,
but pay attention to warmth and tingling and are you getting results, which is the
main thing. So it was her tracking that. And I think we worked with the PS over
several days. I think it was less than a week. Okay. Yeah. Thank you.
Sure.
I mean, I can turn my camera on. Okay. If you don't mind,
that'd be nice. Right now, we have her holding the Potonic Stimulator up to her jaw
area, so you'll see. I don't know if you can see it.
It's pretty dark. Yeah.
Let's see. Oh yeah. Okay. I see you've got it like at the back of the jaw.
So you can see this eye will blink and this eye doesn't. It's Renee would it be
oh would it may I have your permission to put the camera on you alone for just a
second so people can see more clearly what what you're dealing with. Sure. Okay. So
in order to keep it on you, we just need you to keep talking a little bit and
it'll switch to you. Okay. Should we whistle? Whistle.
You can see I have to talk out of one side of my mouth. This side doesn't work.
So that's why it's hard to eat or drink. Yeah.
So it's just a little bit of a challenge and hopefully this will be one of the
shorter durations for it. I have known people to have it the six months so that
would be extremely difficult.
Yes I agree.
Sharon's there with you? She is right here, yeah. So Sharon, can you tell us a
little bit about what you noticed when you did the lens on her? She hasn't yet.
She hasn't. Okay, so it was just you and your husband. We were waiting to hear
from the group here before we attempted it today. Okay.
I'm sorry, I'm not being more clear cut. I'm just trying to think about, I have
had, I have worked with somebody who had facial drooping before, but it was a
result of a stroke, so it was a little bit different.
I have a question,
Excuse me, one of the potential causes they think is a virus infection.
Has there been any talk about using an antiviral? They gave me an antiviral just in
case. They didn't detect any, but they gave me an antiviral which
and they gave me prednisone and two different kinds of eye drops.
Are Are you you're you're taking it? Yes, I finished the Apprentice on today and
still have a couple more days of the antiviral.
Do you tape your eyes shut at night? I have to yeah
yeah them, there's concern about damage to the eye if you don't type your eye shut.
I see on this, this is from the from gaggle and this is Mike Beasley's thing that
he says at the very end, ""remember when in doubt place the sensors around the area
of interest and run an application that matches that person's physiology on that day.
So we could certainly do maybe what body lens sensors in a circle or something on
maybe that side and and run it until we see a change.
Do you when you do it do you watch for a change in the face? You're gonna watch
for a change on the screen. You might get a change on the screen before you get a
change in the actual phase. I don't I don't know
I'm thinking aloud here, so but just bear with me because I I Think that's a yeah
Does anybody else have any input on that because that I think that that that is an
interesting question
when we took the advanced training with Mike in September in his,
in the little book, he has a specific example of somebody who,
I mean, went through this exactly, and I've got his little picture where he put
the, I don't know if you'll come see that, but where he put the placements. She's
got it too. Sorry, I chimed in late, so if you already talked about that, I'm
sorry. No, Melissa, thank you. Thank you. Hers looks a little different.
She had three photos where we have two on this one. So I don't know, she might
have some other information. Melissa, hold up your your paper again.
If you'll talk a little bit, I'll put you on the being the active camera, Melissa.
And so you have to talk while you hold it up to keep the active camera on you.
So sure. And just tell me if I need to move it right or left or something like
that. So is this the one you all have. Oh yeah that's perfect. Yeah that's a
different one. Well it's not the different as far as the two ones on the side but
the middle picture is different. We don't have that one. Do you have to read out
loud what it says? Yeah. Is that the center placement? Can you tell?
This has affected my eye side a little bit too. It looks like there's one above
and below the eye and then over to the side of the eye It's what it looks like.
- Those are body lens sensors, huh? Right? - Here, I'll read it. He has,
okay, so this is exactly what it says. It's the result of nine cycles of two
channels of body lens on the motor strip and the trigeminal nerve. Different sensor
locations were used on C4, CZ and around the eye. So It looks like we have a
ground next to the eye, references right on the brow bone and right below.
So those are references. And then your actives are stacked on C4.
So he put the two sensors on top of each other on c4 for the active ones oh okay
interesting can anybody upload that one you know um let me think about how we could
do this i um melissa is there any way that you could if you have a phone handy
that you could take a screenshot of that page and send send it to my email
Let's try it.
Think I've ever stopped centered.
I'm going to go to my email and see if there's anything.
Melissa, let me just find out if that's possible. Excuse me, I'm scanning it right
now. Oh, thank you so much. You're welcome. I just wanted to meet myself, so you
didn't have to hear background noise. Nice. Do you have-- Thanks, Melissa, I really
appreciate it.
I have something to add. Okay, clearance. Go ahead. Um,
I, this summer, had a macular hole in my eye,
and had surgery, and after that surgery,
I went to Florida to Miami to get a stem cell injection for my knees.
I'm falling apart apart a little bit. Anyways, when I was down there the doctor
gave me stem cell eyedrops and in three days I went from 2040 to 2015 using stem
cell eyedrops. It is an incredible treatment and they do do strokes.
If you're interested in finding more about it and this doctor, you're welcome to
contact me, but I was skiing two days ago on a cracked knee.
I mean my knees are pain -free and my vision is corrected vision is perfect with
the stem cells. So if you need any help, let me know.
Cheryl, thank you for that lead. I mean it's good to know and it's good to know
somebody who's actually had experience with a particular office. Yeah, so thank you.
Okay, somebody's got there, if you're not speaking would you please mute your
microphones thanks
we're getting background noise from some somebody I don't know right
I just sent that to you oh right okay
Okay magic to happen.
I'm just gonna check make sure it didn't go to spam. No, not in spam, which is
good.
Okay Melissa, did you send it to Psychologics? Oh, here it is. Okay, great.
Face placement. Great Someone's gonna download this photo
Hi, Lisa Staphney. I just posted a couple of articles from Google Scholar just
talking about Bell's palsy and light therapy
But just they're they're But they're showing really nice results, so if somebody
wants to take a look at those available there, the links.
All right.
Okay, Daphne, can you give me permission to share my screen, please?
All right, here's that, and then, okay, here is the photo that came through if all
good things are happening you guys are looking at a picture of three images of
somebody with a droopy face yes yes yes thank you okay great so so you're seeing
my screen um and you can see here there's uh the ground is at the side and then
uh reference for channel one and channel too and
Renee we can I can send you a photo.
That would be great I'd really appreciate it Sharon's gonna go ahead and try it on
me. Okay great all right it's real -time real real -time lens.
So here you can see that I guess this is the would be the affected side is the
one that's lower and that's much more moderate
after the lens. And he said when he explained it he said that he did that during
like one of the trainings I believe like it was right there on the spot during the
training. So, I think it was a pretty immediate response for her from what I
understand. Okay. Well, no pressure, but Sharon. I didn't mean to do that,
but I believe if I remember the story, we took in a lot of information, but if I
remember it, he had good success with it.
So it looks like the droop was on the left side and yet the C4 the two sensors
on C4 is on the right side. So the opposite side. So with the control of the
body, it's on the opposite side.
So the left side of the sensory motor strip affects the right side of the body and
the right side affects the left side of the body. So if your symptom is on the
left side of the body you want to put your active sensors or whichever sensor
you're using but on the sensory motor strip you want to put it on the opposite
side.
And Rebecca, we're just, I just want to let you know I have not forgotten about
your information that you sent me and we're going to do that right after Renée has
her lens. Okay.
Thank you.
See if there's a way to make this one, the featured.
Hey, Lisa, Stephanie. Uh -huh. Is it possible to stop sharing your screen? I think
I've got, I've got two of everybody. It's totally, totally possible. Beautiful. Okay.
All right. So my question was, is there any way to make this one, make them the
presenter? Okay.
Let's see. Well, can I take it back if I make her the presenter?
I can't. Okay, we're gonna make her the presenter and see if that makes them bigger
on everybody's screen.
No, that's me. That is not what we want. Okay, Lisa, do you want me to send it
to Melissa? Is that what we're looking for?
To Renee or to Sharon. - Okay,
got it.
- And that way they'll be bigger on the screen. Everybody can see it better. That's
what I'm thinking. - It's not giving me an option to make Renee McGuire a presenter.
I'm gonna send, try unmuting. I don't know whether I can, maybe that's holding me
up, is you're muted over there
Renee?
Easier way there If you hover over Renee's video and click the right button in the
top right corner that says pin, that's something we can do as participants to make
that video just stay there for what that's worth. So they're bigger.
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's not allowing me to send over presentation to Renee. You know
what, I think this is, for me this is okay, I don't know about for the rest of
you, but on my screen they're in the middle and it's larger than it was, so is
that how it is for other people,
maybe?
Yes, it is. As long as we pin it, it's larger.
Okay. I don't know if it's because everybody pinned it or because I pinned it, but
it's pinned, they're pinned. And that's good. Thank you, Rebecca, for that. I have a
question about running the is do I choose body lens or do I choose head lens.
I mean it doesn't it doesn't it matters as far as how the data is stored so this
is non -standard data so I would choose body lens.
Sharon when you're asking that question are you talking about launching into the lens
software or what application to use?
No, just launching into the software. Got it, thanks.
As far as the application, I was just going to start running like the standard body
lens, which is the 22nd ish one. Let's start there.
You run it nine times in this particular.
That's how I understood. Arrange it. OK. That's why I'm standing. Yeah, I would be
doing exactly what Mike did. So monkey see, monkey do. Yeah, let me just jump in.
He's the dumb monkey. I mean, come on. Let me just jump in for a moment. So it
was during a training that session. And so the nine, there's nothing magical about
the nine, except for that worked. That's where it got to the point where what you
saw in that picture was what was happening. So if you get that, it may not,
it may take nine, it may take more, it may take less, it may not be helpful, it's
hard to say, but we don't know how much it would take. But I'm kind of with Lisa,
try and see, so go ahead. Yeah. - Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and run it. I chose
C3, C4 on the head that popped up. I I think it really matters.
- Okay, Mike stacked his, right, on C4? - Yeah, but you can't choose, you can't
choose the same spot twice. - Oh, I see what you're saying. In terms of just
picking a place for on the head, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, here on the program. Just in
case anybody had that question later of like, well, what do I pick? Okay.
All right, you ready? - I'm ready. - Okay.
Okay, so we just finished, that was a 22 second Body Lines program. So Sharon,
are you watching the screen when it's-- Yeah. Okay, so what are you noticing in
terms of the dominant frequency there, or the spectral display, either one? You see
anything that's static or something that you can
Watch for change. No, I didn't I didn't see anything significant The the the waves
actually look
Least like they they they look like they're mimicking each other. So they're not
like very very different from each other The dominant frequency is about an average
of four so one 3 .5 the other says 4 .5 and it was kind of running pretty
consistent in that area. Okay that's helpful thank you.
So other than that yeah I didn't see any like change blips or anything like that
while it was running. Okay so you're gonna go ahead.
Hold on let me, Oh Someone's here, so I just want to make sure that
If you all wanted to go ahead and talk about the other one while she continues to
run that's Okay, and we'll check back in with you in a little bit. Okay, great
idea Renee
I'm gonna unpin you but we'll be back Okay, Rebecca Smith you're up.
Let me see here. So you guys, Rebecca, sent me some information on a client that
has a condition that we haven't really discussed here before. It's called poly
microgeria. So that's a long word. But if you take it apart,
poly means many micro means small and the gyri gyri are referring to the folds in
the cortex.
Can Rebecca, can you tell us a little bit about your clients attributes while I'm
getting your maps up? Sure thing. So our main hope is that to improve his fine
motor on his left side, he's 15 years old, pretty, pretty stoic. And the main goal
would be if he could tie his shoe,
there's a number of things he can do with his left -hand gross fine motor skill
-wise, but they're looking for fine motor improvements and kind of the, you know,
Western medicine has said, you know, we've gotten you to as far as we can,
and so we're just hoping to to help, if possible. This condition normally comes with
seizures. He's never had a seizure.
There's some toe walking, so it affects his left leg as well. He's had surgery on
the heel cords,
but there's still some toe walking there. He's learning to drive right So that's
another thing where like he could do it, but it's just a little more cumbersome
than ideal
And so far we've done the map across two sessions and His mom has noticed that he
feel he's more relaxed and chill He's more talkative about other things besides
sports because he's really into sports and and she noticed on the first time
receiving lens it looked like his left hand relaxed and did things that it hadn't
done before but that was more just her observations so is there anything else that
would be full.
What's his sensitivity? You're able to do a half a map at a time, and that suits
him okay? Yes, he was not wired, tired, irritable, anxious afterwards.
So I use,
yeah, so he didn't have any 10s. He was kind of medium on, but like I said,
he's also very stoic. So he's after half of the sites you know at two seconds 100
% he was kind of tired in real time so then we stopped.
That sounds good. It's interesting he likes sports does he participate I'm trying to
picture him in my mind so he's got motor dysfunction it sounds like the fine motor
is the bigger him. Is he is he able to like walk normally? Does he have?
Yeah, he can walk fine. Like, there's just the toe walking component. And then he's
able to shoot a basketball, but just primarily with his right hand. Okay.
Okay.
His mom needs to give him a lot of verbal reminders, which, you know, seeing T
five as suppressed as it was, I was curious about that. And then the whole frontal
lobe is in delta, which he's 15. I don't know if that's normal for that age.
I would say not necessarily, but are
you guys seeing my I just need to verify that you're seeing my screen 'cause we
were doing some different things with the... Are you seeing a map? - No. - You're
not. So we probably need to share my screen again.
Thank you for your patience with that sometimes it's I'll think that you're seeing
something and you're not and then that is Frustrating for everybody. So, okay if all
things are going the way I think they are you should be seeing a standard map
Yes. Yes. Okay. Great. Thank you. Okay, so I don't have any way to visualize what
you guys are actually seeing. Yeah, so okay, so here we've got the mean total
amplitude, and these are unremarkable, which I think is interesting. I think I was
prepared for them to be higher. They're not, which is not a bad thing,
it's just interesting. And the reason I say I was prepared for them to be higher
is it's, he's got a physical anomaly in terms of his brain structure and so a lot
of times with situations like that you'll see you'll see high amplitudes but not
here but a lot of suppression in terms of amplitude just like us here there's just
like one pixels worth of blue on a couple of these and then nothing on T3 and T6
so pretty static.
In terms of the dominant frequency, here's that frontal delta that she was talking
about.
Interesting. And then you can see in the delta map itself, that big puddle of delta
toward the front,
alpha in the back.
Okay.
Let's look at the suppression map.
So no surprise that this is mostly coat coating is orange because We didn't see
much blue on the standard map
In your email you mentioned that one of the hopes would be that he would be able
to tie his shoes Yes, and I was just going to say It may be easier for him to
learn to tie his shoes on Off his foot to start with so if that's something that
that you guys are hoping for I
Would actually give him something to practice on like just like you do for for
younger children whether sometimes it's a board the lace -up board and you practice
tying on that.
Yeah
in terms of cognition and mood management is he typically developed in those regard?
As
it shows, it's a real healing skill.
And then you just have to be able to manage.
Rebecca, I'm sorry, your phone was cutting out there. Could you repeat that? Oh,
sorry.
- Yes, so mood -wise, it's pretty flat, I would say. Pretty stoic,
used to have outbursts, but now doesn't.
And then the meaning is just remembering, like, you know, verbal, like,
hey, it's time to go, like the verbal reminders the mom has to do are pretty,
pretty frequent. And again, you know, is is that temperament is that we don't know
why that is but my guess would be because of T5 and T3's suppression but I don't
know.
Well I mean it's it's tricky because with the lens we're looking at a network like
this the network of suppression and so I can see why you'd be interested in those
sites, but I wouldn't get to to wound up over them specifically. I would just
continue what you're doing. It sounds like yes, he's responding. It's hard to know
what to look for with him. In a lot of cases, this is true for younger children
with developmental issues as well. So, and I'm going to, I'm going to classify this
as a develop, probably to develop more like a developmental problem than like a TBI
you know is that what you see is you see them behaving more like their normal
peers so for him it might be that he doesn't need as many reminders but he might
for a while that's a lot of Delta in the front you know I mean his attention may
not be great but you might see you yeah I would just watch for things that look
like he's growing up a little bit more. So if that looks like taking a little more
initiative in family life, like I don't know in a lot of families at the end of
the meal the expectation is they can take their plate and put it in the sink or
they'll scrape their plate or something like that and then a lot of times it
doesn't happen then the mom has to remind or the mom has to do it. If you see
him spontaneously doing any of those things that they've been modeling for years.
It's finally kicking in. You know, I think that that's consistent with what we often
see with the lens is that people just sort of start stepping into the changes that
we've been hoping that they would have. So it doesn't sound like he has a lot of
behavior problems or mood problems, so you can't watch for those to go away. You
have to watch for the emergence of things that are consistent with growth and higher
functioning.
But the fact, I don't think that that was a mistake that she saw his hand relax
in a session. I've heard stories where it's happened to other people and I have
seen that myself in cases of cerebral palsy, which is the closest thing that I can
think of here. Cerebral palsy is a little bit different in that often there's not
necessarily a structural difference in the brain, but it functions different. So in
his case, they've identified a little difference in the way the cortex is actually
folded. But you know, his right side works okay.
So that's good because the right side can help the left side. We've got this, the
symmetry, this desire for symmetry.
As we were discussing earlier, when you're, when you're trying to, if you're trying
to target a symptom on one side of the body, it's a motor symptom, you're going to
look contralaterally at the sensor placement. So if his problems are showing on the
left side, and you wanted to try to figure out where things are gummed up, it's
probably on the right side, but you're still going to honor that network of
scholarship gradient that you capture in the map. So, I mean,
if you got through a couple of maps and you're not seeing improvement, then
I might consider a different way of working with it, but I would work with the
gradient that's there. He's got a lot of suppression. I think you should start to
see that lifting, particularly in amplitude. It's just really static. So,
if you do you have access to a photonic stimulator?
Something similar, but not quite the PS. All right. So, yeah, so you might consider
doing this, eliminating the sensory motor strip. He didn't like it though. Oh,
okay. Yeah, and so I told him it was his choice, of course Yeah,
do you know what it was about it that he didn't like?
Well, I told him I basically was like yeah You might feel a little heat and you
can tell me to stop at any point and within a minute. He said stop
so I It could be a sensory thing. I'm not sure why I can ask him though.
I think that'd be a great idea because it could because he was bored or something
else. I mean, it's a little bit different when we're asking people to sit there and
you're doing the photonic on them for people that are restless or sometimes it's
just hard for folks to it and wait for you to shine the light. If that's the
case, there might be something you could have him do while you're doing it. Or, but
like you said, if he says no, then I wouldn't, you know, I would just say, I
think this might be something additional that could be helpful. But I'm like you,
I don't force it on people 'cause I like to be in alignment with them. - Yeah.
- I wonder if it was just weird for him and for a lot of people,
especially kids, if something's just not around familiar.
And yeah, invite curiosity about it.
I didn't catch how old he was, or yes, 15.
And have you done body lens on his feet?
I'm thinking about that next, because I talked to him about if he was open to
doing body lens on his hand, and he's going to think about it. But once I heard
about the toe walking, I was like, okay, maybe we could be on the feet. Because
that maybe there seemed like a, of course, garden is around body lens on the left
hand. So maybe the feet would be good.
- Rebecca, this is Daphne. How long is he been toe walking? - That's a good question
and I don't know. I can ask though. - Yeah, if it's something that's been there for
a while, one of the things to consider is reflex integration. And that would be
different than what he presented with regard to the polymicro,
the, what you're the thing, but worth taking a look at.
And I don't know enough about it. I reach out to a lens provider who does this
type of thing, but if it is due, the to walking is due to something like reflex
integration, that's something that could be helped, you know, fairly, yeah, with,
well, I'm not going to say quickly, although that could be part of it. So anyway,
something to say. Thank you. If I had a client like that and I had a clinician
around who did reflex integration, I wouldn't hesitate to bring that to their
attention as a possibility. But I will say that I've had clients who only received
neurofeedback, including lens, and the toe walking resolved. Because it's process right
so you know earlier when I was saying I would treat this more like a developmental
looking for things to improve so the degree to which there's toe walking is another
thing you as a sign of progress Another question is do you know if this disorder
is accompanied with Or if he has any autoimmune type reactivity
That's a good question. They haven't mentioned it
What was the name of the disorder again, I didn't remember it So it's Polly micro
and then it's G. Y. R. I. A It's a genetic thing.
Yes. Thank you. - Thank you.
- I want to kind of piggyback on something that I just said really quick. One thing
that I, 'cause I primarily work with kids, if I work with adults, it's just 'cause
it's their parents. But one thing that I stress at the very beginning is we can
all come in with certain goals. But I was telling them, I don't get to check the
boxes to what happens first. So we need to make sure that we're always looking at
the whole picture as to what Lynn's can do. So I ended up creating three separate
trackers that I send home with my parents every week and then they just check it
off 'cause I found that I was wasting my whole session going, ""Well, did you notice
this? ""Did you notice this?"" So I'm happy to send it, but I also, I created it
with chat GPT and I explained who I am, what I'm doing and here's what I want.
And so I created one specifically for mental health, sleep, all the common things. I
created one specifically for sensory components and I created another one specifically
for an academic tracker and each one has 50 boxes Or about 50 boxes of things that
they're gonna track and so this way it's for one It shows all the things that lens
can do But for two it just took a lot of the effort off of my part And it
allows things that maybe they weren't expecting to happen that have happened that
they just maybe breezed over and didn't realize was actually changing. So anyway,
chat GPT is a great friend. So you can certainly use it for that or I can send
it. But it's been a game changer. As far as for clients to see things and just
know sometimes we don't get to check the boxes as to what we want. Shoot time
might be a great goal. But I can't promise that that's what we're going to see
first. So there's that. The other thing was I do have some that we've done multiple
maps on the head and we just haven't quite seen exactly what they're looking for.
So then we do transfer to the body and we do the body and I'll use the dermatomes
map to kind of track where we're doing and what we're, you know, where we're going
to go on the body for specific ailments. And it depends on how woo woo my clients
want to go. I get a lot of woo woo holistic alternative medicine clients, which is
my four tail level when they can do that because we get a little bit more free
reigns to run with the chakras and trapped emotions and this kind of stuff. But the
Dermatones is a great map to try to match where the physical ailment is with what's
going on in the body. So, and then my only other thought, and this just because
autism is my specialty area, whenever I hear toe walking, I just go like,
I mean, and I'm hearing some of the things that he's saying as far as, you know,
the constant repetitive stuff. And there were behaviors, right? And you've got to a
walking. So that could be something that also plays into some of the behavioral
components, which lens helps with the behavioral components of autism. But anyway, I
don't know anything about the diagnosis. So it could also fall under a lot of the
same symptomology that autism presents with. But it just made me kind of think of
that as well, because then there's some parenting things that need to come in. If
autism is a play, And then if that is the case, I would also kind of dive down
the rabbit hole of the studies on mirror neurons and how those play into kids and
autism as well. So that's that. Thank you. Melissa,
great. Someone has their mic on.
Thanks, Laura.
So Rebecca, I just wanted to mention is there is something that when Melissa was
talking about the symptoms and the emergence of the behaviors and how you don't get
to check, and that is so true. We were talking earlier about the shoe tying.
Shoe tying is a skill. That's not a normally emergent thing,
but something that would actually assess the functioning of his left hand and arm.
So you might want to get a writing sample even though for most people the non
-dominant hand of course it looks terrible right so you some kind of copy task and
prepare for it to be big so developmentally when children start to write they write
with their arms they move their arms first before they move their hands so it goes
from a gross mortar motor to a small motor but see if you can get some kind of
sample of his skill at this point in time, and then if it's something that's
difficult for him, you don't have to have him do it frequently, but have him do it
after several sessions and have him repeat it, you probably will be able to see
some progress there.
- That's good, thank you. - I can just say that gives us another day to put it.
So.
- Yes, Thank you.
I was surprised with one of the kids that I worked with who had cerebral palsy.
His handwriting improved spontaneously. So we were getting samples but we were not
having him work on it. His coordination just got better and his handwriting improved.
So I mean I'm assuming that this kid is right -handed because his left side is the
one that's affected. is that correct he writes with his right hand yes yeah so I
would get a handwriting sample of his right hand as well yeah
makes sense thank you and I hope you'll keep us posted on his progress because we
can all learn from this situation in this case yes thank you all for your help
Yeah, okay, so let's quickly Well, thank you again Rebecca for bringing this case
for discussion and then let's go back to Renee We've got just a couple of minutes
here. So Renee and Sharon If you're there, they've left that they've left the scene
But I think they're probably still hovering around so let's see or
maybe not. There she's back. Okay. All right, Renee.
Welcome back. Yes. I'm going to pull you up on the camera and I'm going to pin it
because that's my new skill of the day. Melissa is saying if you want her trackers,
send her an email. So her email address is in the chat. So don't miss it. If
you're interested in, you'll hear that. All right. Okay. All right.
So here's Renee.
Welcome back.
Thank you. Sharon's not sure. She saw in the middle more of a change,
but she said it might seem worse at the moment than it was in the middle,
but I felt a lot of tingling, like
um like nerves jumping so I am hoping for um as the day goes on that it gets
better we shall see and then I'll use the ps oh that was the other thing how long
and where um to use the ps should I use it at the back where the nerve is
originating or just all along the,
or the nerve runs from my face?
- I don't think there's a clear answer to that, honestly. I mean, we don't know
where in the chain of information transmission, things are going wonky.
Where does it feel like you should put it?
Well, I was doing it back here like that behind my ear initially and I was feeling
some tingling from that So, okay, so you were getting some response Right.
My personal preference is usually to go to the root of the tree So I would go
like the back behind the ear is closer to the source of origin You know,
so that's probably where I would do it. Okay, you know, if you do it and it seems
not to be helpful, then do something different. But you already got some evidence of
response because you said you experienced tingling with it. So, but I did give a
little little bit of time to just see how the lens plays out as well. And I will
be back on next week to show you if there's any change.
I'm so glad that you said that because I was hoping that you would. So thank you.
Thank you for being here today and thank you for your willingness to to be visible
while we're doing it. It's you're seeing is believing and it's really helpful for
all of us. So I appreciate it so much. I appreciate Sharon for being there as well
and participating. Me too. Yeah me too. Okay, folks, we've come to the end of our
hour, so let's just say goodbye and thank you for being here.
I'm going to unpin Renee so we can look at all the faces. Let's see. All right,
everybody. Have a great week. We'll see you next time. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks,
Renee."
11/26/24 Webinar Link,"Discussion includes:
(1) Case of 16mo infant with a genetic seizure disorder since 4 mo. Focal seizures are managed by medications and keto diet but infantile spasms are present 2-3 times daily. Recommendation: use grounding mat, then introduce the red light on the fingertips, and then administer LENS to mom while she is holding the child. Will report back.
(2) Reviewed map of Carl’s patient, presenting with DID, from recent webinar discussions. Update: no longer experiencing incontinence during the day.
(3) Difference between LED and lasers.
(4) Case of prostate issues causing frequent urination throughout the night and sensation of needing to relieve himself throughout the day.

So you got anything that's been rattling around in your mind a
question about using the lens or a Potential application. Let's talk about it So
Sean I see you're here with us today. Did I pronounce that correctly? Is it Sean
or it has various pronunciations But usually what do you prefer? Shan Shan,
okay Okay, so Shan wrote to the listserv about a very young child who's having
seizures and wanted to talk about the potential of using lens with that. So could
you give some background to the group please for people who do not follow the
listserv that closely? For sure. So this is a someone I know who has a baby just
turned 16 months. I think at about four months of age they started to notice that
he was having seizures so he had I think tonic and chronic seizures that are now
stable but he's having also infantile spasms so they are still at a frequency of
about two to three a day sometimes they are absent for a day,
but they're still there. Let me just see what meds he's on now.
These are stable. Do you mean they're still happening at a steady frequency or
they're not apparent anymore? The infantile spasms are still occurring. But the
underlying cause is, which I'm not familiar with, it's a SCN1A mutation.
So it's a genetic mutation that has caused focal epilepsy. So that is,
they are not seeing those focal seizures. - Okay. - He is on a keto diet,
which has really helped him. And he's on, I'm not gonna say this correctly,
toporamate, toporamate.
That. - That was enough. - That was enough. And levitaracetam,
levitaracetam twice a day. So he's on medications that are controlling the focal
epilepsy, but he's still having the infantile spasms two to three times a day on
average, with some days not having any. So he's 16 months,
I would say he's a little bit delayed in development, is certainly his language,
I mean, not that he would be, you know, speaking a lot at 16 months, but he's,
I would say he's a little bit delayed. He's a large 16 -month -old.
He can certainly be present and engaged, and, you know, he's still,
I would say, within his benchmarks, But his care team has wondered about
neurofeedback for him and so we were chatting and I said well I'm learning have
been practicing lens for a little bit. I will ask whether this would be something
That might be helpful. Of course, my anxiety would be high because he's 16 month
old Sure, and I also have not had experience working with seizures to this point
Okay, how long have you had your lens? July. Okay so it's really good that you're
asking the group. In the old days we used to say you know wait till a year or so
before you take on somebody with seizures. It doesn't mean that you can't help them
it's because people largely worked in isolation at that point and didn't have very
many observations under their belt. I think you're fine to help him to try to help
him with other people helping you. Working with a very young child is not all that
different. In some ways it's a lot different. In some ways it's not that different
from working with older people because you're still going to gauge the amount of
lens that you do based on the sensitivity but with young children they are very
sensitive. So it's always going to be a very light touch with that.
The people who recommended neurofeedback for him probably were thinking of more
traditional neurofeedback. Correct. And what I can tell you there is the general
strategy-- the primary thing that people do with the really young ones is what they
call a broad inhibit. You're just trying to keep the amplitudes from being so high.
Because when the slow wave frequencies get going, they build on each other,
and that's what explodes into a seizure. The brain has trouble controlling its
energy, and of course with a young child like that it's all slow wave. I mean they
don't really, they're not really manufacturing the faster frequencies yet to any
significant degree. So that's one of the reasons why seizure disorder generally has
its origin, you know, unless there's a head injury, it usually has its origin in
early childhood. And sometimes kids can outgrow it because as they mature, their
brain is capable of making higher frequencies that can offset and control that lower
activity. With the lens, we don't have exactly a corresponding principle to the broad
inhibit. What we have is a disruption of the timing, that when the amplitudes line
up, they build on each other and they're summative. So if you take an amplitude of
10 and an amplitude of 10, it gives you a spike at a 20, or much greater in the
case of most seizures. So what the lens does is disrupt the timing so they don't
build on each other in the same way. - Okay.
There are a couple of things that I personally would try in preparation for the
lids. One of them was I would put the baby on a grounding sheet or a grounding
strap and That will cost a little money. I mean, but it's basically what it does
is help those amplitudes stay lower It discharges the build -up of static electricity
in the body and it helps the physiological signaling be more efficient. That alone
can help drop high amplitudes.
And the nice thing there is that something that the baby can do while they're
sleeping.
So and it's something that they can do in between their visits with you as well.
So That's the first thing that I would do. And there are different types of throws
or sheets or mats or whatever. I mean, they're different price points and that would
be up for the family to pick.
But probably something soft like a throw or a... The baby's not that big.
Even a pillowcase size might do the trick. - Okay. - You know, you just, you need
for the skin to be able to touch the fabric and um so I would start with that
and I would watch the baby for five to seven days okay if you get any effect on
the infantile spasms and
then after that I would introduce um red light on the fingertips and the toes And
it's 16 months that the babies probably still get in their diaper changed, you know.
So diaper change is a good time to do it. And I didn't make that up. One time I
was talking to a client, it was a child client, I was talking to the mom and I
was suggesting that they do the red light on the fingertips and she said, ""Oh, kind
of like what they showed us when he was in the NICU."" So I had no idea, but in
some NICUs they will use, excuse me, they will use things like that. Lily,
okay, all
right, hopefully you won't be able to hear the barking from the other part of my
It's far away now, but I hope y 'all can't hear it. Okay, so anyway, just a tiny
little bit of, I get one of those little laser pointers, like the ones I'm showing,
you're not usually on the call. So let me show you what I'm talking about. There
are any-- - I've put it on one where you've showed one before. It's just like you
can pick them up at the dollar store or something, yeah? - That's right, the dollar
store, or they have them on eBay, they have them on Amazon.
It's just, it'll be a visible red light, somewhere between 650 nanometers and,
you know, 690, whatever their cell and that'll be fine as long as it's visible red.
It's just a tiny bit of stimulation to those digits. There's a lot of sensory
fibers in the fingers and toes. For people who have seizures often have trouble
screening out external stimuli and it loads up on them. So just that little bit of
stimulation I think will help build the tolerance and also it can help give a
little bit of a reset. Okay so so first I would try and if they can't if they
can't get the grounding sheet right away and they want to start something tomorrow
you know you can start with the red light first. I don't know that it really
matters what you start with first, but
my personal preference would be the more foundational thing, which would be the
grounding sheet. Okay, and I just Google one of those. I've never heard of ones.
They're called them grounding or earthing sheets. Earthing sheets, okay. It plugs into
the ground circuitry of the building, so you have to be in a house with grounded
circuitry, but most houses now have that. If you don't have a grounded outlet
available, then you can run a line out the window and put it in the earth, which
hardly anybody actually does that, but I've been told that it's a more pleasant,
even more pleasant feeling. So that's an option.
- Okay, so start with that. see if they notice any changes in the seizures.
And then we could come back together and say, maybe that's enough or maybe-- - Well,
it depends on what they're seeing, right? If they're not seeing the problems anymore,
then between the meds and maturation and that little intervention, it's probably doing
its work. My guess is because this is a genetic cause. It's probably going to
always be challenging the child. So, you know, it's not if if they don't notice any
improvements with those interventions, I would keep them in place. But then you add
the next layer. The next thing I would do is have the mother hold the baby and
treat the mom. Okay. Just with and with the mom,
you could treat her on the head, but just a little bit.
- Tell me how that works, other than obviously she's more regulated and her nervous
system is contagious, but-- - Yeah, there's still a connection there. And this is
not, I didn't make this up, other people have done this as well. So it's not just
me who would try this. Now, if you try it and you don't get an improvement then
we'll go to the next level. I mean I'm just thinking about the ways that you can
gradually introduce a little bit of disruption to that nervous system that's under
challenge. So just have the mom hold the baby in her arms or in her lap and you
can put all of the sensors on the mom that first time and just see how how she
responds, how the baby responds. And in fact, do you, if you're going to have the
sensors on the mom, I would treat according to the sensitivity of the mother,
but just let her hold the baby. Okay. Because the baby is downstream from the mom.
And
it can be or body. It doesn't matter depending on her sensitivity. It probably
doesn't matter I'd probably put it on the head myself but yeah I don't know them
what's the mom's constitution like? Very hardy, very calm. I can't imagine that that
we wouldn't be able to go right to her head. Okay, yeah that's fine.
Yeah and then after that
If you're not seeing, excuse me, if you're not seeing progress, then I'd put the
sensor on the baby's foot
and I would use body lens.
All five sensors on two feet, like between the two, you could use five or you
could just use three
And gentle, four seconds, 100%. - Yeah,
so definitely 100%, four seconds sounds good.
- 20 offset?
- Maybe 100. - 100 offset? - Changing the offset is a very slight thing in terms of
what actually happens. So, you know, 20 would be okay. I would probably do higher
until I understand how the baby is responding now if none of this is making a dent
Then you know, you're just gonna probably the next thing to do would be drop the
offset Okay,
super. Well that gives me something to chat to her about and see whether Those
steps would be helpful And you're you're definitely reliant on their ability to to
notice the infantile spasms, but my guess is that it's pretty conspicuous when it
happens. Yeah, I think they know for sure. This is not likely to be a situation
where they're going to dial back the seizure medicine very much. The baby's growing
and seizures are life -threatening and destructive events.
It's if if the baby just does better and stays on medication that is still a win
Okay, it's I know a lot of times People want to come off medication or they're
eager for their child to be on this little medication as possible The baby is going
to grow So if the dose stays steady, but the baby is growing in a fit that is
like a reduction in So, you don't have to get real tied up in whether or not they
cut the meds back or anything. Okay.
Okay. And a lot of times children will grow out of seizures. Now with the genetic
component, I don't know what the odds are. I think the hope is, you know, that
with maturation there would be at least there's hopeful prognosis,
you know, whether from the very little bit that I know it, you know, it's variable.
So I think the hope is that that the infantile spasms would outgrow in terms of
the other types of seizures, they may always need that medication to be under
control. I don't I don't know.
Yeah. - Well, like I said, seizures can be destructive. So the main thing is to
help them not happen. - Yeah. Okay, so that's a great place to start. And then I
can, it'll probably be at least two or three weeks before we go through those steps
and be able to report back.
- Do you have a photonic stimulator? I'm guessing not because not yet 'cause there
have been been out. - They've your plan. All right, well, then I think you're set
up with a game plan and keep us posted. I will too.
Yeah, thank you for that. Great, you're welcome. Let me just take a look here and
see if Carl is with us now. Carl sent me a couple of maps last night.
Um, Let's see. Hey, Megan, could you give me permission to share my screen, please?
Thank you. Thank
you for your patience.
Carl I'm just getting your maps here. I got them last night, but I was not with
this computer. So, all right, we go back here,
okay? Sharing,
where'd it go?
I saw them download. I know they're okay.
Let's see. Okay. So Carl has spoken with us about this client before. Carl,
for those people who are just dropping in today, you want to give a little
background on faith.
Adopted from an apparently terrible situation at age roughly three.
Adopted into a family where the mother is a DID. She's definitely a DID.
She recently went to jail for
Domestic violence. She went on a date with somebody that she got on a tender date
and he expected sex and Normally she gives out sex, but she didn't want to and got
in a fight with a guy went to jail
She came back out of jail talking about her personalities Which was a jump for me
she She explained that she has a toddler who likes to suck on people's nipples.
And that's a real baby and then there's a toddler. And she seems to think they're
the same person, the toddler and the baby. I'm not sure. But she has a seven -year
-old who sometimes is nine years old. So I'm not sure whether we have two separate
people or one. At least one of those was anally raped,
whether she was seven, nine or both, we don't know.
There's so much that you probably are never going to know.
Yeah. Yeah, well, Well, she's still coming to work with you, though. Yes,
she is coming to work with me for a few months. One exciting thing about it is I
put the photonic stimulator on her spine at the places where my chart shows nerves
come out and go to the bladder. And I did that, and I also did the place behind
below 02, which is supposed to help. And She says she's no longer leaking pee in
the daytime
Yeah, huge it is Congratulations
Yeah, I would recommend anybody who has pee women to get a chart and put their PS
on it, you know
Yeah, Okay, all right, so are you folks seeing a map of Carl's data?
- I am. - You are, okay, great. All right, so let's just take a look here.
He sees the highest, interesting. So all of them are showing standard deviation.
Now Carl, can you tell us what application used to get this data?
I made a map of four seconds offset of 20.
I just tried to get a map. I did other things before this but this this time I
just went through with a map
I think well, let's
see here. Let's look at the other ones hard to go
All right, that's the same one. That's not what we want. >> I tried to send you
four, but obviously you only got three or two more to do. >> Three. Okay. Well,
here's some suppression data.
Well, look at that dominant frequency site sort. Look how much nice blue you have.
My memory of the very first time you showed us information on her was orange,
orange, orange. I'm pretty sure that's true.
There were a whole lot of places that had no blue on the black and blue chart. I
think it was, or I don't think there was any blue showing, or still there wasn't
much.
I'm curious,
being a DID,
do you think that I have to treat her in her different personality places, states,
you know, like, as if they were each a different patient?
Well, I mean, if you, if it's, it might be of interest to keep track of it that
way if she's differentiated enough that you can know like depending on the person I
think sometimes you don't always I mean
yeah I'm sorry Carl I mean if you can clearly tell when you've got a particular
state in in front of you, personality, then maybe make a note of it and see if
you get some kind of interesting continuity that way. That'd be a learning experience
for all of us if you want to track it that way.
I think the biggest thing is that functionally she's making progress and she's
changing. So whoever was sitting in the chair this day,
you know, The frequency domain is pretty freed up.
Can I jump in here, Lisa? Sure. Yeah, I would second what Lisa said,
to keep track of it if you can. Has she presented different parts of her
in in front of you She talks about them. I Have a bit able to have a conversation
with any of them and you might ask her Who it is,
you know, that's showing up if it's only it which which one it is that's showing
up for the sessions
There's co consciousness of some level per it sounds like.
Also, just a detail. We normally talk about people having DID,
not being DID.
He's a DID. You know, it's like he's a PTSD or she's a depression.
I got the concept. Yep, and
I think I shared that the way I conceptualize it is you've got one body and
multiple consciousnesses and a number of them might think they're the primary person
when in fact they're all sharing that consciousness. So,
yeah, and I think it might just be, when you get a very different map,
you may have a different piece showing up.
DID is really interesting neurologically.
So, yeah, it's if certain parts are not on board taking their medication,
the body's not taking the medication. There are,
and since I don't know that I've had anyone with that particular presentation, but
just the nature of this disorder is it can have profound effects on the physiology.
All Like that's what I have Yeah, I I didn't mention she Claims to hate pot,
but does it and when she does she gets really whacked out hmm And who yeah,
I'd be like who's who who in her system like
That is a good question
Carl, I just admire your willingness to work in a situation where it's like you're
walking through the forest blindfolded with a lot of this and trying to find your
way.
Is there any difference between how she shows up and how you're expecting her to
show up? Like is there any degree to which she matches who you're expecting or how
you're expecting her to
there's a difference last time she came in she was pretty depressed so there is it
but most of the time she presents relatively the same okay I
don't know at this point or if any point if it will really matter if you had
distinct maps on the different personality states, but you might discuss that concept
with her and see if she has any interest in exploring that and which might make it
possible if you if you wanted to to get a little more access to some other part
who might be willing to be mapped. I don't know that it's going to get you
anywhere faster and so I'm not pushing you to do it.
I'm just trying to think about what could help you feel anchored in your work here.
She's improving. She's not leaking urine during That is, that's a real game changer,
you know, that that's just functionally, that's a really big thing.
So does she associate that with a baby part being forward momentarily?
She was born with some degree of spinal diffidant. She She doesn't associate leaking
with any of the personalities that I know of, but that's another good question.
I think there's another map here that you sent. Let's see what we've got.
I downloaded it already, but I can't get it. So let's see. 20.
Okay, so was this from a different day, Carl?
- I dated them when I sent them.
- Yes, okay. - Yeah, they're two different days. - The date's not showing on the map
and I didn't see it and I can't get back to the thing. - They're two different
days. - This was the higher number, so I'm guessing a little bit later in time.
So, okay. - That makes sense. Well,
it's interesting to see as much blue as we see for her Given how profound her
symptomatology is Isn't it so stay tuned? Stay tuned.
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for the
David Fenster maker. Are you the primary therapist or you the ancillary NFB treater?
She's had a primary therapist for years.
So I'm asking you what your job is?
I'm giving her the neurofeedback, and the other therapist is backing out leaving me
with her. Oh, then you are the primary therapist. Yeah,
effective this next week or two.
We're-- the plan is to leave her with the option to continue to see Breeze when
she wants to.
I guess my first thought, is that OK with you? Is that something that you've got a
readiness for?
Yeah, I And so, I'm rather like this meeting, I'm in a meeting with Breeze for an
hour every Monday, so we get to talk about him.
That's wonderful that you have that collaboration opportunity.
Thanks Carl, that's all I, I was going to say some other things. If you were going
to be the ancillary trader, you would be used like a psychiatrist who prescribes
Listen, but it turns out you're going to be handling the entire therapeutic sequence.
So thank you. Thank you for asking us. We think about it.
And that one other little thing, Lisa, you said you admired my willingness to go
out in there.
I'm excited about working with her. It's fun, you know, from my point of view,
it's fun. - Yeah, it's trippy.
- Okay, go to somebody else now. - Probably a little projection on my part, 'cause I
recently got somebody with a symptom presentation I've not seen before,
and I am feeling a little bit like I'm wandering in the forest blindfolded because
the primary presenting problem is memory. So she can't tell me very much.
So,
yeah, and in fact, let me pull the group. Carl, thank you for sharing about faith.
Let me pull the group and see if we have anybody else who has a real -time
clinical need. I'm going to switch. Let's see. If everything's gone right, you're
looking at squares of people now. Yeah. Okay, excellent.
Alright, so let me see if we have any other hands up. Gail in your hand is one
more quick thought for Carl is that I've worked with a number of people with DID
without exception there's they're going to have parts that are phobic of affect of
emotion both positive and negative what throws most people is a phobia of of affect.
So it's good to just kind of have that in the background, knowing there are going
to be parts that once they start trusting you, that's going to cause them to
mistrust you.
And it's sort of, you know, it really twists the brain in a way.
And it's useful to label it as such, I find,
I believe, 'cause then it's, oh, then we take it a little more seriously and it
makes more sense that we have a fear reaction to feeling, to people sharing positive
emotion with us 'cause we're so suspect of it. Everybody feels like a sleazy used
car salesman. The nicer they are, the scarier they are at some point.
The other shoe is about to drop. That's what I had to say. Thank you.
Thanks Galen. Jack, I see your hand is up.
Yeah, Cheryl was up too. Maybe get her first. I don't see Cheryl's hand,
but Cheryl, you want to say something? Hey, Oh, it's on the screen. I see it
there, but
we can't hear you
Lisa. We have two screens. I Hey What do you what are you seeing?
The screen that had the map on it is still up with faces as well as one behind
that Can you hear me now? I can hear you. Yes,
you can't see me. Maybe not worry about the other Okay
Real quick, I have three three questions the first question is the photonic
stimulator that is Red light therapy correct laser It's a longer wavelength Then when
people say red light therapy, they're usually talking about something that is visible
red Usually somewhere between 650 and 690 700 it's the photonic stimulator is a
longer wavelength which gives it deeper penetration into the body Are you familiar
with the laser levels, the classes.
It's not laser. It's not laser. It gets similar effects,
but they're not the same. So they started using the term LLLT,
low laser. They did have laser in the word that was like low level laser therapy.
Then it kind of switched to low level light therapy because it turns out that the
incoherent light at the long wavelengths can penetrate the body and have clinical
effect. So with the lasers, the light wavelengths are lined up so that the peaks
and troughs are coherent. And so that's one thing that affects the fidelity of the
of the energy there. With the photonic stimulator,
it's incoherent light,
but it's a wavelength that has good biological effect. I have both, I have lasers,
and I have the photonic stimulator, multiple models. - And you choose the photonic
stimulator. - I use them both, but mostly lately, I'm using the photonic.
I still like my lasers, but I mostly use them for myself. Or if somebody comes in
and they've got a sprained ankle or something, I might give them the photonic, but
if the laser's handy, I might hand them the laser because it doesn't have a cord,
and it's easier to know. So they're used interchangeably. From a functional
standpoint, I'm going to say largely depending on the parameters of the device. So
it's not just whether it's a laser or incoherent light. It's how powerful is that
light? How many diodes are in there? How many LEDs are in it?
The photonic stimulator is very powerful. - How many are in that one? - I don't
know. - Okay. - That was my first one. - I agree. - Because I just bought a,
'cause you didn't have the Photonic Stimulator. So I just bought a laser that worked
for my knees. So I was just wondering if, okay, next question.
My, this is amazing to me. My husband for years has been talking about having
prostate problems. and the other day he was really upset. He's like, ""Oh my God,
I woke up five times last night. It burns. I'm urged. I have an urge all day
long."" I gave him one percent, six seconds and magic for two nights.
He didn't get up. He was fine. We fixed it. Perfect Then it started me.
He needed another dose went down gave him and that lasted three days gave him
another dose of the same That one lasted two days and now everything's back again
Do I double the dose? I had it perfect
For three days, I'm gonna open the floor to to commentary from the other attendees
and see if any anybody has a suggestion here
anybody who might have done Work with prostate before I have not
Is it a problem that waxes and wanes in general Cheryl? >> I don't think it's been
going up and up and up.
>> Betty, you have your hand up? You have something for Cheryl?
Oh, you're turned off your mic.
>> I mean, it was just gone for three days. >> Yeah, a lot of problems are like
that. Let's see what Betty has to say. >> So my question to you, Cheryl, is were
you doing head lens with him?
>> No. >> Or body lens? >> Body lens. >> Okay. >> I put the five nodes around
his penis, one on top, and the others like under his leg area.
I actually had to look on a map and see where the prostate was because I didn't
know.
But yeah it's in between the anus and the penis so I went from the front and
tried and circled around the whole area.
You think it would make a difference with head lens?
I think so.
Okay.
Why don't you put one channel on the head and one channel down there? Oh that's a
good idea. Oh that's a great idea. So the genitals are down inside the cortex right
under CZ.
So, if you're going to go to the head, why not go to that CZ area? Okay.
So, when I set it up, do I hit body lens or head lens?
I hit covered body lens, just so you don't get it mixed in with a map. And When
I do the body lens, after you hit settings,
there's two in the standard applications. There's two body lens applications.
Does it really matter which one you hit? I don't know what you have in your
formula for what's labeled as body lens. probably something different than what I
have 'cause I've had my lens longer and I've got a bunch of old applications. So I
would look at them, Cheryl, open them up and see what the recipe is.
- Okay, but it's most likely I'll go, if I'm doing the body lens even on his head
that I would probably go to the body lens. It's not really any different.
It's just labeled differently. >> I see. Okay. I wondered that. Okay.
There's a great-- >> So, the computer, the reason we segregate body lens from head
lens is that you don't want to mix your body lens data into your maps. >> Okay.
>> So, for people who run body lens just using the map head, it's fine.
Some people have the special software called body lens. >> Yes. Yes. Other people
just run head lens, but they put it on the body.
If you label the application body lens, then when you go in to look at your map
data, you don't end up putting that data in with your head maps. Okay, very good.
Okay. One more quickie. Sure. We talked a few weeks ago about NAD.
NAD?
Is that right Galen was talking about NAD? Yeah, yes So I was wondering about If
you are familiar with
liposome Somal gluta Bion
I think quick quick quick answer is no. Okay. I'm not familiar with it.
I don't know that much about NAD. I just learned about it off of Huberman lab.
So. What about NAC? In acetylcystine, yes.
That's a really powerful antioxidant. And we've talked about that here before.
Combined with NAC and I ended up buying NAD. Uh Yeah.
Well, they may have some use. Okay. So we were talking, yeah.
You asked about liposomal glutathione. Yeah. M -A -C is a precursor to glutathione.
So some people take liposomal glutathione to get around that conversion of inocidal
cysteine, but
It's sort of a personal preference kind of thing. So that's what the glutathione is,
major antioxidant. And that's where you're going with the enocidal cysteine. - Okay,
so I did make a mistake when I bought NAD instead of NAC,
right? - Yes, the letter matters, yes. part of the challenge here is it's difficult
to supplement glutathione directly. Most of it is passed out of the system instead
of being integrated. So that's part of the reason for NAC.
I wanted to throw in on the previous discussion about, so yeah,
if you're used, you'd use the body lens setting but use a head lens protocol
probably if you're going to run it on the head is would be my thought wait say
that again use the body lens yeah yeah if you've got it coated as body lens but
you might if you're putting on the head I would assume you'd still use a head lens
protocol You know, because some of the body lens ones are much longer than you may
be using normally.
Could you reiterate that again? I just, I lost you. If I'm using the body...
You can use any of the programs on either head lens or body lens, regardless of
how it's labeled. Okay. That's the point. Okay. And very quickly,
I want to throw it, so if you're placing the sensors in the vicinity of the
genitals and you're doing body lens and it's getting an effect, the question part is
how much of this is due to a neuroplastic effect and how much of it is due to a
direct impact, impact on inflammation or tissue in that area.
And I have no idea what the answer would be, but I'm guessing because it's instant,
a piece of it at least is a neuroplastic impact so that the brain is getting a
signal, responding to it and adjusting things. But it may also be affecting
inflammation or something else in the prostate directly,
I think we don't know. So that's my comment. Thank you.
Have you tried the laser down there?
It's in the mail. The one for your knee. The laser. Yeah, it's in the mail.
It's in the mail. Oh, you haven't used it yet? I used it at a friend's house. I
was at the Center for Brain Training last week and I used it there on my knee and
boom, it worked really well. So inflammation that's, if the inflammation is a major
part of the prostate issue, that's another tool that potentially might, I've known of
people who've used the photonic for prostate and bladder and had it be helpful.
I don't know that it was curative.
Okay. So one of one of the things that I was gonna say, I know that Len used to
remind me not to use the body lens wires and sensors mixed with the headlands wires
and sensors. Is that your standing Lisa?
No, I mean, yes, yes and no. Okay. Sorry.
Okay, I just take your case. It's tricky, right? You can use, I don't,
I have body lens sensors and I use them some, but a lot of times I'll just put
the regular sensors down there. And I have some medical tape, just that little white
tape that you get from the first day. Yeah. Right. And you can tape them down so
that Cheryl, that might be a way to go. But yeah, you're not supposed to mix
metals. That's true. Right. Right. I just remember that that's what Len would tell
me. So use the regular sensors with tape the head.
Yeah, you still use paste. I mean, clean the area, put the paste on the electrode,
and then use some tape to anchor the electrode. He's still not going to be able to
move around much. I mean, you're not, you don't have to use the tape on the head,
obviously. No. Okay. Okay. Right. Sorry. Yeah.
Okay. It just takes a little piece, just enough to anchor it. These measurements are
so quick, you're not having to, it's not having to stay there very long, you know.
And should I use the same dosage probably?
As, as what you did before? Yeah.
Sure, why not?
I mean, this is, this is an exploration. Okay. And exploration. And I would just
tell him that you need to keep that spirit of exploration and you'll try to help
him. But it's not a surprise that it was good for a few days and then came back.
We see that often with symptoms that tend to be chronic symptoms. It can take a
long time to tease that apart to get things to really go away.
So I think it's impressive that you made a dent Yeah,
I was excited. Okay. Thank you. I'm good. You're welcome. Jack. I see you have your
hand up
Yeah, I was just gonna ask Carl the The PS where he's put it other than the O2
that he said It seems like he mentioned another site that he uses for the urine
incontinence?
Yeah, I got a spinal chart from my friend of mine and I marked them out.
I could grab it and give you the numbers if you want but that's what I did.
I have a chart that says you know three is one of the bladder spots and it just
mentions them. - Oh, okay. Where can we pick one up?
- I got mine from my chiropractor.
- Also, I'd throw in here on that,
the brain maps the genitals and feet next to one another. So,
if you're targeting areas of the genital, K1, I think it is,
on the bottom of the feet, and I would look at those charts, see if you get
anything from the feet, and clearly if that changes things, Cheryl, for your husband,
then it's going to suggest a neuroplastic impact, but that doesn't mean there's none
of the things going on in the brain.
OK. Thank you.
So you can get an image of what's called the homunculus. It's the layout of the
sensory motor strip, the parts of the body that are associated with different places
on the cortex. If you Google homunculus and look images, you'll you'll find that
little pictures can come up and they'll show you the allocation of the sensory motor
cortex associated with different parts of the body. Okay. Cool.
So that's how I love this console. I love it.
I love it.
It's a common problem, so it's, you know, there's some problems that don't typically
show up in a psychologist's office, but they're real life problems and they cause
people misery, so it's good to talk about it.
So let me see if we have any other hands.
Cheryl, I think yours is the last hand. Is there anything else that you have on
your mind?
No. Happy Thanksgiving. Oh yeah, so much to be thankful for.
So we're not going to get to my person today, the one that I was talking about
walking through the forest with the blindfold on, but I'll give you a little bit of
background just so that when those are your saying your prayers can keep me in it.
So she's she's like 51 years old. Her memory has been declining for the last 13
years and at this point She just very,
very poor short -term memory, just like in conversation.
She's come to me referred from the Med Center here. She's got a neurologist over
there who's worked with her. She went twice through a program of cognitive behavioral
therapy there with no effect. I asked her what she did with that psychologist. I
said, ""What did you do with Dr. Weeks?"" And she said, ""I don't know, but I did it
twice."" Anyway,
there are some abnormalities on the MRI, but they don't see how they would relate
directly to the memory problem. She has episodic loss of personal memory,
so she went on a trip to Costa Rica with her husband and some friends and she
sees the pictures but she does not remember being there so that sounds a little
dissociative maybe but it's very they're very specific deficits it's not she doesn't
misremember that entire epoch of her life but she doesn't remember that trip um and
then she has a history of traumatic brain injury when she was younger she was in
abusive marriage and sustained some head injury. Now her paperwork says there were
two abusive marriages and I'm not sure whether they're right or she's right. I've
only met with her twice. Both times she asked me if I've worked with anybody who
has her problem and I just said well I've worked with people who have the different
components of your possible problem. We don't even know what the problem is, right?
We don't know whether it's degenerative, although she is worsening with time. It
could be a brain injury that's aging poorly, or it could be some underlying
neurocognitive deteriorative process, or it could be some dissociative stuff mixed in
with it. So I don't know. I'm going to try to help her and I'm just telling y
'all so you can maybe can help me carry this a little bit because it's pretty
daunting. She doesn't remember my name from visit to visit which I don't take per
car
and drive somewhere where she doesn't even know who she's going to see. She
remembered how to get back to my office. So she was able to encode that. I asked
her, I said, ""You told me last week that you probably wouldn't remember my name,
but I just want to check in and see if you do."" And she said, ""Oh, I tried to
think of it all the way here, and finally I decided it's Kathy."" And I said,
""Well, those are good odds, but no."" And so I told her my name again, and then
later in the session, she did call me by name so at least in that hour you know
she was able to hang on to it she's very pleasant she's very worried about herself
which she should be I mean it's it's it doesn't look good so I don't know like I
it's it's hard because she really can't tell me very much she can't tell me how
she does when she leaves. Of course, I've only seen her twice. So there's not a
whole lot to be able to report. But she doesn't remember anything. I ask her if
she's had hormone therapy. She doesn't remember. She brought me some of her medical
records, but not all of her medical records.
And I'm not part of the medical center. So I can't really, I don't have access to
their electronic health records like one of their practitioners would. So that's
what's new for me. We've come to the end of our hour. I want to say to all of
you, I'm so thankful to know you. I'm so thankful we have this time together. We
are lucky to be doing this work and happy Thanksgiving, everybody. - Happy
Thanksgiving, Lisa. - Thanks for sharing that. - Thanks, Megan, for doing this with
us. - Bye bye. - Bye bye."

11/28/2023 Webinar Link,"Discussion includes: 
(1) Question about currier wave always being on or not, and if the duty cycle effects this. It is always on and the feedback is what changes, the feedback can be more disruptive (choppy) or smooth organized affect. Feedback signal has greater consequences. 
(2) Lisa shares Youtube video discussing the disruptive nature of electrical devices around us https://youtu.be/BwyDCHf5iCY?si=-QFhV4QsxpUuF8fJ 
(3) Guidance on Shingles patient. Lisa shared her client that had many health issues, shingles being one of them. The LENS and PS Light took her pain from an 8 to a 2 but doesn't stick due to virus still being in her body. Recommended to use light on fingertips and on area with the most pain. Resilience Score is key for these clients. 
(4) Reviewed picking the site sort after full map. Lisa shared her preference of treating based off the suppression map, starting with the highest orange bar. She skips the pink and blue bars. Lets the blue “sort itself out”.
(5) Discussed how our mental state and mindset for the client in front of us can affect their results. Getting the client to have a mindset where they have hope and can imagine what their life would look like without their symptoms. 
(6) Shared audiobook(free on amazon) by Heart Map called Heart Intelligence. Discusses stories on the hearts intent and wisdom and the how powerful the heart can be and affect health results.

(8) Discussed/demonstrated alternate techniques to the salt water technique. Contact Solution for salt water is best, but table salt can work in a pinch. Kayle shared technique with popsicle stick and wet sponge. Chris shared technique with wet headband can work but risk bridging that causes flatline. If no flatline and clients are improving, keep doing what you are doing.

(2) Discussed treating stroke patients: results can progress slowly, rarely have imediate results. Photonic Stimulator highly recommended for stroke patients. The map can be helpful to track suppression lifting and restoration variability. The healthier the cient was before the stroke, the better/faster the LENS results. LENS can help regain movement, example of case where client able to swallow solid food again after a few sessions.Important to tell client since they may be swallowing a certain way to compensate, start with small bites carefully. Stroke and TBI both see better results the sooner they start treatment after event occurs. Lisa shares case of Stroke client with dilussions about location of work/home, after some LENS was able to accept reality. 
(3) Question about treating non-epileptic seizure client who has been hospitalized twice recently. Medication is unstable, not consistant or correct dose. Typically recommend waiting until medication routine is set. Assess the questionnaires to decide where to start. Educate patient on possability of breakthrough seizures. An increase in the what typically occurs leading up to seizures (ex Aura, mood swings, etc) are NOT a regression, is signs of improvement. Start with single site. 100% min 4 seconds. Photonic Stimulator or small lazer pointer can help stabalize. Put on tip of fingers and nailbed few times a day. See if notices any signs of change ex: yawning. 
(4) Case of 60 yr old female client who can't hold composure throughout the day. Crying non-stop. Noticed frequency of frontal lobe is not lifting. Is microdosing mushrooms, wondering if that is effecting it. Possability of it being a seizure/migraine?

(11) Mom of very disruptive child who has completed 6 sessions, mom is hesitant to continue if she doesn't see more progress. When asking questions, discovered there were changes happening, they just may not look as extreme as the mother is hoping. Moms anxiety about him getting better can make her bad reporter.
